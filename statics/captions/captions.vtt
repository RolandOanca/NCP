00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.560


00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560


00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.620
Two years ago, I had to get my ear operated
on because of tinnitus.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.690
As I was laying on the cold operating table…
Completely
paralyzed with fear...

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.869
That dreadful ringing which has been tormenting
me for years grew louder and louder!
I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.490
wanted to scream: “Doctor, doctor!  For
the love of God, please don’t cut my ear

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.700
off!”
But no words were coming out of
my mouth.
With the corner of my eye, I

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:42.660
saw the sharp scalpel getting closer and closer
to my ear…
I said “God, help me!”

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.230
and then everything turned pitch black.
When I finally came back to my senses…
The

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.650
surgeons told me they had to slice the back
of my ear and lay it wide open in order to

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.100
“fix” what they thought was wrong with
my horrible ear ringing.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.140
“Well, we did open up your ear canal a bit
but the bones were intact,” the doctor said.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.680
“Hopefully it still helps the severe tinnitus,
but we can’t be sure.”

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.350
Even so, days after the operation, my ears
were still ringing louder than ever…
I

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.780
was completely devastated and I felt like
I would be stuck with Tinnitus FOREVER…

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.380
What happened to me, sooner or later can happen
to anyone…
But even though that was the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.319
most terrifying experience from my entire
life…

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:37.509
It was that precise nightmarish moment that
sent me on a mind-bending journey...
Which

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:45.409
eventually led me to the discovery of a completely
natural and inexpensive method that makes

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.030
it possible for you to finally clear your
ringing and regain your hearing again!

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.839
I’m Gerard Watson, and today I want to literally
bring truth to your ears…

00:01:58.839 --> 00:02:01.740
That’s because in just a few moments, I’ll

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.649
show you where tinnitus REALLY comes from…

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:14.159
And how a simple technique recently discovered
by scientists at leading medical universities…

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.819
Could make it possible for you to hit the

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.760
“mute” button on that aggravating ringing
on your ears.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.760
Scientists say that once you listen to a short

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.970
series of sound therapies and add a group
of certain natural ingredients in your diet…

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.620
you could re-train your brain to cut off the
ringing, roaring and whooshing in your ears…

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.500
That no matter how much earwax you dig out…

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.560
how many antibiotics your doctor gives you…
or how religiously you attempt to quiet the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.630
noise banging around in your brain...

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.560
You’ll NEVER get rid of the debilitating
effects of tinnitus until it’s COMPLETELY

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.599
snuffed out.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.230
And that’s really GOOD news… Because inside
this short presentation…

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.599
You’ll discover a totally natural technique

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.440
that could PULL THE PLUG on tinnitus, even
while you sleep.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.830
Developed by a team of ear specialists and

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:20.250
sound technology experts… this technique
doesn’t require hearing aids, new chemical-laden

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.189
medications… chronic ear flushing, or surgery.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:30.390
In fact, once you see exactly what this sound
therapy technique does… how it turns your

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.640
world so quiet and clear again…

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.309
You’ll be AMAZED at how SIMPLE and inexpensive
it is…

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.030
No more stuffing your head in the pillows

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.189
at night to escape the sounds roaring in your
ears…

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:50.400
Or dosing up on nighttime sleep meds just

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.849
to get a short reprieve…

00:03:52.849 --> 00:04:01.480
Forget the headaches, dizziness and pure frustration
at being “trapped” in your own head, too…

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.890
It sounds incredible, I know…

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.269
But, as you’ll soon see with this brief

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.739
presentation…

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.060
Just by following a couple of easy techniques
that I’m about to show you…

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.170
You could enjoy the moments of silence you

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.370
longed for…

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:24.940
Bringing you INTENSE relief and the ability
to CONCENTRATE for once without having ear-piercing

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.800
sounds keeping you distracted…

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.180
And excelling at work without having to stop
and say: “What?” all the time.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.860
You could be finally able to relax and enjoy

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.919
your family and friends, even in the noisiest
of environments.

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.090
Best of all, this strategic and scientific

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:54.100
technique is fit for ANYONE… no matter how
bad they suffer from tinnitus or how old they

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.100
are…

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.889
Because just by following the simple sound
therapy technique I’m about to show you…

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.550
Which, unlike everything else out there, is
even more powerful, as it is coupled with

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.150
a miraculous natural solution specifically
designed to calm down your nervous system,

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.080
not by a money hungry Big Pharma company,
but by a brave group of people who have been

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.900
struggling themselves with tinnitus for years...

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.340
Your brain could be re-trained to suffocate
tinnitus on a biological level…

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.699
Ridding your body of the anxiety resulting

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.509
from a never-ending noise explosion inside
your head…

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:35.889
Dramatically helping additional hearing problems

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:42.040
associated with tinnitus… cutting out the
possibility of major ear surgery…

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.550
And feeling like a “normal” person again.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.919
Now, if you’ve suffered from tinnitus for

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:53.860
ANY length of time, I’m sure you’re curious
to find out this simple technique…

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.460
And take control of WHAT you hear and WHEN.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.400
So let’s not waste any time…

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.639
I want you to know who I am…

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.240
Why I know a secret trick that ear…

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.379
And how you can put this secret to work for

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:18.920
YOU… in order to FINALLY achieve the blessed
peace of silence inside your head…

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.200
Even if you can’t remember how GOOD it actually

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.200
feels.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.050
So, as you know, my name is Gerard Watson.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.930
I’m 55 years old and live near Denver, Colorado…

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.889
And two years ago, doctors cut my ear off

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.949
my head to “fix” tinnitus.

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:42.789
The chief surgeon said the horrible hissing
sounds in my ears were the result of broken

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.110
ear bones, but after he cut into my head,
he discovered…

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.110
Nothing.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.310
Nothing AT ALL was physically “wrong”

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.280
with my ears.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.110
And I woke up feeling like he’d drilled
through my skull with an ice pick… My ear

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:04.889
was fire-hot and swollen off my head, stitched
back on like Frankenstein…

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:06.400
All for NOTHING.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.819
The ringing in my ears not only remained there,

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:13.240
it got WAY more wicked after that…

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:19.750
And even worse, he’d accidentally cut a
facial nerve, so my tongue lost all taste

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.520
and felt like someone burned it with acid…

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:27.869
As you can imagine, this experience was horribly
eye opening…

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.240
Not to mention EXPENSIVE…

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.150
And I’ll tell you more about it in just

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.870
a couple seconds…

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:40.810
But before I do, it’s best if you know how
I got to the point of having my head cut open

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.530
to begin with…

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:49.539
Ever since I was a kid, I had bad ear infections
that kept my doctors dosing me with antibiotics.

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:55.060
I had tubes in my ears, poor hearing and learned

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.250
to read lips pretty early on…

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:05.110
I wasn’t deaf by ANY means, but ear problems
became the norm in my life from a young age,

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.300
even though nobody else in my family suffered
from it.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.110
So, when my ears started ringing one day out

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.560
of the blue, I wasn’t too alarmed.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:20.060
I mean, the older you get, the worse your
hearing becomes, right? The ringing and whooshing

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.580
in my head just became something I accepted…

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:30.800
Up until two years ago, when a drill siren
struck through my skull.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.200
I was in a meeting with fellow music executives,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:41.599
and all of a sudden, it was like someone banged
both sides of my head like a set of drums…

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:44.110
All I could hear was a high-pitch tone that

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:51.550
drowned everything else out… like that loud
alarm tone on the emergency broadcast system

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.190
when it takes over your TV...

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:58.870
I covered my ears and looked around at everyone

00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:59.870
else…

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:07.810
But nobody was experiencing this weird pain…
they were all staring at me like I was crazy.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:12.540
I left work early hoping it was just a fluke

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.630
and would go away…
But it didn’t.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.950
The dinging stayed with me even into the night,

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.120
where it proceeded to keep me from sleeping
a wink.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.690
The next day, it was still there… Only now,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:29.790
there was a sensation of blood pumping through
my ears, too…

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.310
Concerned, I called around and asked a few

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.680
colleagues for the best ear specialist out
there…

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.661
After all, I was in the music industry, which

00:09:39.661 --> 00:09:43.290
is notorious for causing hearing loss.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:48.250
Luckily, I was able to get an appointment
right away, and the doctor…

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:52.750
Who was a top-notch surgeon who came HIGHLY

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.200
recommended…

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:59.540
Immediately sent me to get an MRI scan on
my head.

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.589
A few days later, as he reviewed the results

00:10:02.589 --> 00:10:07.870
with me, the doctor said he still wasn’t
sure what was wrong with me.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:11.410
“You do have unusually small ear canals,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.550
which accounts for your infections growing
up,” he said. “And I do see a blockage

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:21.920
in your right ear, which could be a broken
bone, and that might make the tinnitus worse.”

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.980
“Okay,” I said. “So what now?”

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.829
My doctor said surgery was probably the safest

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:32.389
bet, and had my operation scheduled for the
next week.

00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:35.920
It all happened so fast, and at the time I

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:40.050
was glad I’d be able to have the procedure
done so quickly.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.740
Looking back however, I wish I’d known then

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:46.040
what I know now…

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.860
The surgeons had to slice the back of my ear
and lay it wide open in order to “fix”

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.260
what they thought was wrong.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:59.300
Worse still, was the news my doctor gave me
when I finally got done throwing up from the

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.300
anesthesia…

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:06.670
“Well, we did open up your ear canal a bit
but the bones were intact,” he said. “Hopefully

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:13.110
it still helps the severe tinnitus, but we
can’t be sure.”

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.110


00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:16.040
My ears were still ringing, a hot pulse surged

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.140
through my ear drums… I felt so utterly
deflated.

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.519
“One more thing,” he said. “We cut through

00:11:23.519 --> 00:11:28.610
a taste nerve in your jaw. Your mouth might
tingle or burn for a little while, and have

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:34.890
a funny metal taste, but it will go away.
Happens quite often.”

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:41.170
So THAT was why my mouth felt halfway numb,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.670
halfway on fire?! I thought it was the vomiting…

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:49.639
If this all sounds horribly disgusting, that’s
because it WAS.

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:56.170
Now I had tinnitus AND a severed taste nerve…

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.550
And I felt like I would be stuck with it all

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.550
FOREVER…

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:06.160
I was distracted all day at work, trying to
concentrate but getting thrown off by the

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.300
constant nagging in my eardrums…

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:14.790
They finally told me to take a leave of absence
because I couldn’t hear over the swooshing

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:21.759
sounds in my head, making me useless in the
music industry.

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:24.130
Not only was I anxiety-ridden and feeling

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.920
trapped inside my jail of a head… But I
was getting majorly depressed, too…

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.970
Which meant that no matter how I did it, I

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:39.980
needed to escape this life sentence of having
the nails dragged down the chalkboard in my

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.170
head… disturbing every part of my life.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:51.090
And so from that moment on, every single moment
was spent researching medical publications,

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:58.040
studies, scientific journals and periodicals,
even alternative methods of treating tinnitus.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.290
You have a lot of medical experts saying tinnitus

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:10.730
is almost impossible to treat with ANY method
because there isn’t one root cause for it…

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:17.660
They suspect loud noises or injuries to the
ears COULD lead to tinnitus, yet some people

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:21.670
suffer from it without ever being exposed
to damage.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:24.000
Which makes sense because even though my doctors

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.380
told me I got it after years of listening
to music way too loudly…

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.190
I still knew a lot of people who suffered

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:39.119
from tinnitus their whole lives WITHOUT being
exposed to anything harmful to their hearing.

00:13:39.119 --> 00:13:42.160
But even though they may not know exactly

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:48.860
what makes people get tinnitus, scientists
DO know what it does inside your head…

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.570
Tinnitus roots itself deep in the brain and

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:59.440
causes a complex interplay of brain signals
to go wrong. It begins with damage to tiny

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.569
vibrating receptors called “hair cells”
in the inner ear.

00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:06.329
But regardless of why you get tinnitus or

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:11.370
what it does inside your brain, people are
still desperate for any possible remedy that

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.980
gets rid of it...

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.769
Like using hearing aids to “mask” the
sounds inside your head… expensive and annoying

00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:21.120
to wear in your ears…

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:27.209
Anti-depression medication and “sleep”
drugs to calm the panic attacks and anxiety

00:14:27.209 --> 00:14:33.779
kicked up by tinnitus… which don’t get
to the ROOT of the problem, just zone you

00:14:33.779 --> 00:14:35.050
out…

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:42.100
Fake chemical remedies, acupuncture, meditation
are also used… Fine for overall calming

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:48.230
effect, but they cost a lot of money and are
not that effective.

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:50.570
And then there’s surgery, which I personally

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:58.160
knew doesn’t work… Let alone the physical
and financial pain…

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.490
As you can tell, the research was unnerving…

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.680
And I can’t tell you how many times I almost
gave up.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.010
Well, there must be a higher power out there,

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:14.359
because barely a week later, I FINALLY found
the one thing that changed everything…

00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:17.170
That would end up giving me peace of mind

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:18.170
back.

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:25.389
I’d searched the Internet, read piles of
books at the medical library and made a ton

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:30.070
of inquiries with doctors and specialists...

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:35.470
When I came across two obscure studies that
had me doing mental backflips.

00:15:35.470 --> 00:15:37.970
Both of them came from an expensive site that

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:43.649
published medical journals for sound therapists
and research scientists, but the price meant

00:15:43.649 --> 00:15:48.120
nothing if I could find the vital information
I was after.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:51.440
The first study came from the Washington University

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:59.009
School of Medicine in St. Louis, and showed
tinnitus patients participating in computer-based

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:02.610
training reported incredible improvements.

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:08.540
Specifically, the study groups listened to
a series of sound recordings focused on improving

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.260
the processing of sound, speech and memory.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:18.380
That sounded too good to be true, and it really
got my attention… Help your tinnitus by

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.489
doing the ONE thing you never thought you’d
normally do ever again—LISTENING.

00:16:23.489 --> 00:16:26.290
And the second study came from the University

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:33.079
of San Francisco, where scientists had attempted
to use sound therapy to fix tinnitus…

00:16:33.079 --> 00:16:37.819
Basically, the USF scientists were using a

00:16:37.819 --> 00:16:43.680
customized acoustic “stimulus” delivery
system, called a “Neuromonics” device…

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.649
And it was introduced as a means of promoting

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:54.630
neural flexibility within the hearing system
in hopes of abolishing tinnitus-related ailments.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.699
In plain English, what all this means is that

00:16:57.699 --> 00:17:02.610
the researchers were playing a pattern of
audio stimuli…

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.810
Sounds that had been scientifically designed

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.910
to retrain your brain to get it working properly…

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:15.380
Well, after reading about these successes
with sound therapy techniques, I was completely

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.330
intrigued…
I mean, this was my background, I’d spent

00:17:19.330 --> 00:17:26.850
my LIFE burning new sounds onto CDs… perhaps
I could do the same inside the human brain?

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:30.080
I began making calls to the smartest sound

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.670
technologists in the industry. Maybe someone
else knew about this, too.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:38.610
Well, not long after I’d left messages for

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:48.450
every single composer, sound tech, music executive
and studio producer I knew… I had my breakthrough.

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:51.080
One of the major symphony composers of ALL

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.760
time returned my call.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:18:01.600
He told me he’d suffered from hearing loss
and tinnitus for YEARS… but that he’d

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:09.890
overcome all of it by simply LISTENING to
a certain mix of altered music and audio tones.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.440
He said he knew all about Neuromonics, which

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.150
required a special listening device and costs
$5000 for treatment…

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.582
“But it’s unnecessary, because with the

00:18:21.582 --> 00:18:27.060
state-of-the-art equipment at the studio,
I created the same sounds at a fraction of

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.270
the cost.”

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:33.170
This guy was the BEST in the business, who’d
suffered from a case of tinnitus almost as

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.780
bad as mine before using his own version of
Neuromonics.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.880
And it made sense, because top composers like

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.450
him are “doctors” of sound. They’re
mathematical geniuses and brilliant at knowing

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:51.220
exactly how music and tone works inside the
human brain.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:54.100
So, I was definitely sold… And, even better,

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.920
he was willing to reproduce copies of his
recordings for me...

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.260
Now a REAL solution was within reach… and

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:08.820
it could help so many other people out there
suffering from the mildest forms of tinnitus

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.640
to the most severe cases…

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:17.880
You can’t imagine how relieved I was and
how anxious to get it working…

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.300
This was what I’d been searching for…

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.150
And when a huge box of hard drives arrived,

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:31.040
filled with the highest quality sound therapy
recordings, I stayed up all night sorting

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.440
through them.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:40.240
In the end, I combined the two most effective
ways that could make your brain cut off tinnitus

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.790
and re-train itself naturally…

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:49.460
First, a version of Neuromonics that used
music, with soundtracks adjusted to scientific

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.990
algorithms that could provide a relief from
tinnitus…

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:55.670
There was also a ‘neural stimulus’ added

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:02.210
to these recordings to further aid the relaxation
response… a portion of which is purely used

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:03.730
while you sleep.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:10.770
Second, I used sound therapy recordings based
on cognitive-behavioral instruction…

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:19.480
Put simply, these are brief listening exercises
focused on auditory speed, sound and memory

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.880
designed to improve brain functioning.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.140
Once I had the 2-step sound therapy technique
sorted out, I grabbed my headphones to be

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:32.620
sure all of the recordings played back perfectly…

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:38.410
If this helped tinnitus sufferers, it would
be a miracle… especially because it was

00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:39.530
so simple…

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:45.720
Something you only needed to listen to twice
a week, for 15-30 minutes…

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.660
Something anyone could do, regardless of their

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:52.000
severity of suffering…

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.390
And something that wouldn’t require any
costly doctor appointments or dangerous prescriptions.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:01.840
I put the final touches on the sound techniques…

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.620
and dedicated the next 30 days to testing
the whole thing out.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:11.700
First, I gathered a list of 20 people I knew

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:18.170
who suffered from various levels of tinnitus—myself
included—and asked them to test out the

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.580
sound therapy program.

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.970
Every single person accepted immediately.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:30.860
Especially because we’d recorded the techniques
in such a way that no one needed to leave

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.150
their house or even buy special headphones
to listen …

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:38.230
They each received a weekly report form to

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:43.530
follow their progress and record listening
times.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:46.150
I prepared to wait weeks for the initial reports

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.560
to come back.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:50.470
But what happened next was amazing.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:56.360
Even after one or two “hearing” sessions,
I was getting calls from everyone in the study,

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:59.270
claiming their tinnitus was WAY less intense.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:05.010
They couldn’t believe it… And so I encouraged
them to stick with the listening sessions

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:08.180
and continue charting their progress.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:14.210
Being one of the people who suffered the worst
from tinnitus, I had doubled up on my listening

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:16.990
to heighten the experiment…

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.850
Which still only put me at about 10 minutes
per day…

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:25.310
And so I was even more SHOCKED at how quickly

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.880
my ears started clearing up.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:35.300
Soon enough, for at least 2 or 3 days in a
row, the horrible ringing was almost unnoticeable

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.450
and my depression was quickly lifting.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:43.060
My headaches went away and I was sleeping
through the night without ANY problems.

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:51.270
And by week 4, most of my tinnitus symptoms
had disappeared.
On a scale of 1 to 10,

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:59.700
my symptoms dilated down to a 3.
I was
not 100% treated, but it was way better than

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.140
anything else I have tried before.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.140


00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.890
But it wasn’t just me…

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:11.370
When I went to collect the reports from the
other subjects in my initial study…

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:15.380
The results I saw were astounding, with more

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:22.250
than half of  the subjects reporting that
their tinnitus symptoms reduced by over 60%.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:29.180
They also mentioned a significant improvement
in their hearing as well, which was an added

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.720
bonus I hadn’t foreseen.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:34.880
This was the best news EVER…

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.510
I’d used my sound technology background
and trusted professionals in the music field

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:46.060
to find a solution.
Not a perfect one,
but something that I knew I can make even

00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:52.560
better, so that everyone would finally be
100% tinnitus-free.

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.050
So, I returned to work with more mental clarity

00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:58.440
and focus than ever…

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:04.280
You see… even though I knew for a fact
that listening to the special recordings will

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.200
definitely help silence that dreadful ringing
in the ears…

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:15.320
Just the sound therapy wouldn’t be enough.
The
sound therapy indeed retrains the brain.
But

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:19.910
the brain still needs the proper nutrients
to heal and recover.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:27.040
I mean - if you had tinnitus for more than
6 months of 1 year, there was still a lot

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:34.270
of brain and hair cells damage that was left
untreated, as you would imagine…
If I

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:42.610
were to create 100% working tinnitus treatment,
I definitely could not neglect undoing the

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:48.780
brain damage.
Otherwise, just using the
sound therapy would be like a band aid - fixing

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:54.360
the problems only in the short term and not
actually addressing the root cause of the

00:24:54.360 --> 00:25:02.560
problem.
So, my next questions were
how could I undo all the brain damage caused

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:11.080
by tinnitus and what was the most effective
way to calm down the nervous system and bulletproof

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:18.420
anyone against any future tinnitus comeback?

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:24.090
an on-line tinnitus sufferers group, which
grew to at least a couple of thousands people

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:28.780
in just a matter of weeks.
It was like our little family -  where everyone

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.850
was encouraged to share their experiences
and what natural solutions seemed to work

00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:43.080
best in the long fight against tinnitus.
You
see, I thought if we combined all our powers,

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:46.470
we will definitely find a working treatment
for this…

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:53.750
Something we would all know that would work…
Something tried and tested by us - the tinnitus

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:58.180
sufferers -  not by a faceless, money-grubbing
pharmaceutical company...

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.160
And I must admit - I’m not a big believer

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:09.360
in God, but there sure is a higher power out
there, because barely 3 weeks later, I FINALLY

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.470
found the one thing that changed everything…

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:18.530
As one German hearing specialist from our
on-line group pointed me to a recent little-known

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:26.080
study from the German Research Foundation.
You
see, according to this study, there was a

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:32.300
neuron-soothing natural component that quiets
the roaring-brain cells in your head called

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:39.410
Diosgenin, which can be naturally extracted
from yam or fenugreek, among other plants.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:46.170
Well, I must admit - I’ve never heard of
Diosgenin before.
But when I began to further

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:53.620
investigate this, I found out that this substance
was also being used with extraordinary success

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:58.220
in Japan as well.
You see - the Japanese researchers took

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:05.500
28 otherwise healthy Tinnitus volunteers from
the Toyama Prefecture, in Japan, and they

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.400
randomly assigned who will receive either
a yam extract or placebo.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:18.000
After 12 weeks on the Diosgenin treatment,
the volunteers were given 12 individual standard

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.990
cognitive subtests…
The results awed the researchers!

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:30.710
Diosgenin-rich yam extract use significantly
improved their brain performance while shifting

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:36.130
the attention of the overactive brain cells
to other areas of the brain.

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:43.880
Memory, cognition, hearing, attention, relaxation…
Everything skyrocketed while the sound that

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:51.780
tormented their ears was basically shut off!
This was absolutely incredible!
Moreover,

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.110
after analyzing  all the responses pouring
in from the thousands of tinnitus sufferers

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:05.680
in the on-line group, a number of herbs, plants
and minerals stood up, which everybody claimed

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.920
worked wonders when things got really bad
with their tinnitus.
I knew then for

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:18.330
a fact that compiling the right mix of all
these natural ingredients would be the ultimate

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:24.270
weapon against Tinnitus.
After all, they were proven to work not just

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:30.580
by one person, but by thousands of folks of
all ages from  all across the word!

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:38.480
I’m sure that you’re curious to find out
what this natural anti-tinnitus mix is and

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.350
why does it work so incredibly well?

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:48.680
So please, pay careful attention now, because
the following information comes from our private

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:54.410
medical research, to which the general public
has no access to:

00:28:54.410 --> 00:29:01.420
Here's a short, step-by-step explanation of
each one of the anti-tinnitus brain repairing

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:08.050
ingredients used and how they work...
After intensive lab testing, they have proven

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:16.700
to be 100% effective ONLY in this formula,
specifically calculated and adjusted to give

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:22.570
the best possible results against tinnitus
and brain disorders...

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:29.160
STEP 1: Your hearing begins to clear as the
brain networks and your inner ear “hair

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:33.600
cells” are getting repaired, cooling down
the nervous system.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:40.010
So your tinnitus is driving you crazy and
you can’t stand it for another moment. Both

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:49.430
German and Japanese  scientists have chosen
Yam and Fenugreek as the “first aid duo”

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:56.240
that can lower the sound from the very first
days, thanks to their high levels of Diosgenin.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:04.110
This happens because this emergency team quickly
repairs the buzzing brain networks. Also,

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:12.470
the yam “cools down” the entire nervous
system, while Fenugreek prevents panic attacks.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:18.570
There are over 600 species of yam, but during
our research we’ve found that Mexican Wild

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:24.140
Yam has the most effective type of Diosgenin.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:32.290
STEP 2: You regain your quiet mind while your
brain networks are strengthening and becoming

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:37.330
indestructible.
Dong Quai, a super-herb not many know about,

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:43.370
may take a little longer to kick in but it’s
the one ingredient that definitely puts a

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:50.540
run to tinnitus while helping your brain networks
to become stronger than steel.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:58.300
Not only that but, as shown during multiple
lab tests, Dong Quai also acts like a merciless,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:04.670
double guardian. A guardian of the brain-
protecting it against potentially fatal problems

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:10.260
- and a guardian of the ears – protecting
them against infections.
Saw Palmetto, on

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:17.020
the other hand - balances your hormone levels
- thus preventing irreversible cells damage

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.990
while also decreasing brain and inner ear
inflammation

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:28.300
STEP 3: You feel your memory is stronger than
ever while your damaged brain cells are quickly

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.350
being repaired.
L-Tyrosine, an essential amino-acid found

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:39.870
in certain types of cheese,  is vital for
your brain, as it produces important brain

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:44.630
chemicals that help nerve cells communicate
better and may even regulate mood.

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:51.910
Now, because your brain networks were “broken”by
tinnitus, your brain cells didn’t connect

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:58.290
properly, which resulted in multiple damages,
dramatically increasing a risk in loss of

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:04.250
memory…
But the right dosage of high quality L-Tyrosine

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:09.500
does the impossible by repairing YEARS of
brain deterioration…

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:15.830
As researchers discovered, after just a short
10-day L-Tyrosine treatment, patients with

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:22.590
severe cases of memory loss began regaining
their memories and showed significant improvements

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:28.490
in their thinking and behaviour.
Adding Fennel, which is packed with important

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:37.710
nutrients such as Vitamin C, Calcium, Magnesium
and Potassium, will powers up your memory

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:43.580
and fight off dementia.
This is also the phase when you say goodbye

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:53.990
to fatigue, sleepless nights, dizziness and
brain fog.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:33:00.050
STEP 4:  You feel your brain is supercharged
while cell regenerations starts.

00:33:00.050 --> 00:33:03.670
This is when your mind begins to get super
powers.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:11.440
Motherwort, Black Cohosh and Oat Grass are
like steroids for the brain. As you age, your

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:17.671
brain gets smaller. But not with these three
ingredients as they grow your brain, fire

00:33:17.671 --> 00:33:24.000
up connections and help cell rejuvenation.
The “tinnitus” brain can become more than

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.250
10 years younger and you’ll think faster,
better, clearer.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:35.450
STEP 5: Not worrying about tinnitus and brain
disorders anymore because your brain is being

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:42.230
trained for perfect health.
Finally, this one-of-a-kind formula protects

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:48.610
the brain against tinnitus, memory loss or
other debilitating conditions by combining

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:55.670
high quality Pacific Kelp, Blessed Thistle
and Hops Extract.
While the Pacific Kelp

00:33:55.670 --> 00:34:02.820
and Blessed Thistle  are full of antioxidants
and anti-inflamatory, thus cleaning your brain

00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:09.560
of toxins, the Hops Extract  helps to multiply
the neural connections, improving your brain

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:16.380
function and mood, relieving stress, anxiety
and depression.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:22.409
The “old age” rule, where your mind and
memory start to decline, will be so far from

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:24.590
you from this point forward.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:32.771
There you have it: the ultimate tinnitus terminator
natural mix,
All we had to do now was to

00:34:32.771 --> 00:34:39.240
make it available for everybody: we had dozens
of doctors to provide the medical knowledge

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:45.730
and a state of the art lab all to ourselves.
The most difficult part was to gather all

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:50.330
the ingredients.
You see, the market is full of counterfeit,

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:55.970
cheap knock-offs of so-called "natural homeopathic
ingredients".

00:34:55.970 --> 00:35:01.710
We know this because, after we've carefully
tested 97% of the available natural Mexican

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:09.760
Wild Yam extracts, Blessed Thistle or Black
Cohosh leaves... we found out they were bogus

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:14.140
and derived from chemicals, and not from natural
sources.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:20.310
So we searched the whole world through our
scientific connections and contacted only

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:27.650
certified producers and verified suppliers,
making sure that for our recipe we used only

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:33.490
top quality ingredients, with 100% healing
properties.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:39.780
It was very difficult and exhausting...
We secretly worked night after night, testing

00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:46.020
until dawn, making sure that we got the right
quantities and the most effective combination

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:51.690
of ingredients….
And there were times when I was so tired that

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:56.140
I even threw up, but in the end, there it
was!

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:02.510
My hands were shaking as I was finally holding
the pills that would undo all the tinnitus

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:08.050
brain damage and bring my life and dignity
back!

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:11.230
If this tiny, natural pill, combined with

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:19.530
the sound therapy, was the effective treatment
to tinnitus, it would be a miracle, especially

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:21.890
because it was so simple.

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:25.590
Anyone could take it, regardless of their
severity of suffering;

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:31.680
It didn’t require any costly doctor appointments
or trying any other therapies;

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:38.090
It protected you from the most frightening
brain disorders like amnesia or memory loss..

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:42.690
Of course, I was the very first one who tried
it.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:48.730
After the first pill, I didn’t feel a thing.
Well, maybe hope, which, was still something

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:54.400
I thought that I’d lost forever!
But soon after, everything completely changed:

00:36:54.400 --> 00:37:01.510
I was even more SHOCKED at how quickly
my head and ears started clearing up.

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:07.220
Not only that, but my brain fog went away
and I was sleeping through the night without

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:11.630
ANY problems…
So even though my tinnitus was gone thanks

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:18.380
to the sound therapy, I kept taking the pills,
just to see what would happen…

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:24.370
And sooner than I thought, the results began
to appear:
It was like I had a brand new

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:29.450
brain!
My mind was sharp, I could focus easily and

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:32.260
my memory was crystal clear.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:38.870
Also, my old migraines had disappeared completely...
And it wasn't just me...

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:43.560
When I went to collect the reports from the
other subjects in my initial study...

00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:50.900
The results I saw were astounding!
Not a single person reported getting the high-pitched

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:58.000
OR low-pitched ringing in their ears anymore...
Or hearing their heart beat all day...

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.580
And they also reported a HUGE reduction in
hearing loss too, which was an added bonus

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:10.221
I hadn't foreseen…
Judging by my own miraculous results, I had

00:38:10.221 --> 00:38:16.470
anticipated most of these successes...
But when I heard that one of the participants

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:24.770
in our study had his early onset memory loss
diagnosis treated…I knew I had a mission…

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.660
I couldn’t keep this life-saving treatment
all to myself…

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:34.130
We decided to combine the sound therapy program
together with the brain recovery  solution

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:39.220
and make it available for everybody who's
tormented by tinnitus.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:41.211
This is how the “Neurocalm Protocol” was

00:38:41.211 --> 00:38:42.211
born!

00:38:42.211 --> 00:38:49.950
A revolutionary 2 step program to terminate
tinnitus once and for all:

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:56.400
First, the sound therapy techniques inside
this program will “unplug” your brain

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:03.530
from its internal loud speakers just by LISTENING...
simply and with no effort on your part.

00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:10.290
So I gathered the piles of research and recordings
we’d worked on… And began laying out the

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:15.810
techniques in a simple and easy format for
ANYONE who might want to use them…

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:19.780
Then I created an initial evaluation questionnaire

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:26.560
for tinnitus, to gauge severity for individual
recommendations on which sound recordings

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.560
work best…

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:33.440
I categorized all of the sound therapy sessions
based on what part of the brain they worked

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:40.660
on, and gave technical breakdowns for how
the sounds were altered or enhanced for maximum

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:41.840
potency…

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:49.940
I formatted “listening session” charts
and times, detailing the 30-day program tested

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:55.290
on the study group… Including the weekly
report forms for tracking your success…

00:39:55.290 --> 00:40:00.630
And lastly, I outlined a general FAQ list

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:08.680
for tinnitus and how it disrupts the ear canals,
as well as known causes for the disease, suspected

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.490
culprits… plus a general  “how-to”
section to help you protect your hearing.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:19.930


00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:26.711
absolutely crucial and will repair your brain
networks damaged by tinnitus and calm down

00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:32.890
your nervous system.
This unique mix of
natural ingredients can without a doubt be

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:39.080
called “the ultimate weapon against Tinnitus.”
After all, all the ingredients inside were

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:45.000
proven to work not just by one person, but
by thousands of tinnitus sufferers of all

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.420
ages from all across the word!
Moreover,
it was fully backed by science as well - as

00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:58.570
both German and Japanese researchers showed
without a doubt that Diosgenin can effectively

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:06.020
“shut off” ear ringing and improve brain
performance, memory, attention and even hearing!

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:07.020


00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:12.260
Now that you know the entire story...
You're probably asking two questions:

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:13.260


00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.950
How  can I get my hands on this amazing program?
How should I use this protocol to get the

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.120
fastest results and get my silence back?

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:28.070
Well, to answer question one is a little bit
tricky....
Even though getting the sound

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:34.270
therapy program is pretty easy - actually
- you can even start using it in the next

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:39.260
5 minutes…
When it comes to the wonder-supplement Neurocalm

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:44.630
Pro, things change a bit...
You see.. the truth is that getting the right

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:50.160
ingredients to make this powerful anti-tinnitus
pill is difficult.

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:57.590
As I said, 97% of the "natural" ingredients
on the market are either fake, or filled with

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:01.280
pesticides.
Also, the people who have already tested our

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:09.270
product and regained their long, lost silence
keep asking us for more bottles for themselves,

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:15.090
for their families and friends...
Or just to stock up in case we won't be able

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:20.610
to provide anymore and to make sure that they
will have the power to fight tinnitus for

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:26.400
the rest of their lives.
Plus, there are folks who don’t have tinnitus,

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:30.290
but just take the supplement to rejuvenate
their brain…

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:37.910
Emptying our stocks in just a matter of days.
Moreover, Neurocalm Pro is carefully produced

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:42.630
only in small batches that take up to 3 months
to deliver…

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:48.380
This process is essential to assure that the
quality of the product is 100% effective!

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:56.260
And don't forget about Big Pharma who are
already hunting us like mad for ruining their

00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:02.440
profits that come from innocent people who
are desperate to get a minute of relief.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:08.320
But since you’ve stuck with me until the
very end of my story, in the next few minutes,

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.370
you'll find out how to get your hands on a
brand-new bottle of supplements, as part of

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:20.530
our awareness campaign.
As for how you
should use this protocol to get the fastest

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:24.740
results and get my silence back, the answer
is easy:

00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:31.750
All you have to do is take 2 pills on a
daily basis for at least 30 days and listen

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:38.920
to the sound therapy recordings twice a week
for 15 minutes each time… It could NOT be

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.740
any simpler.
All the strategic tools and knowledge you’ll

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:49.420
ever need can be found within the program.
You’ll see the techniques that could “trick”

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:57.510
your brain into reprogramming itself and eliminating
that ringing in your ears…

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:59.730
Simply follow the instructions inside the

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:07.180
program, showing you how to use the recordings
to cut out the internal invasion of sound,

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:12.880
quiet your mind, promote relaxation and renew
your outlook on life.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:21.010
There’s no doubt that f you follow the Neurocalm
Protocol, your mind will be quiet sooner than

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:22.810
y
in just a couple of weeks...

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:27.270
Then it’s up to you how far you want to
go.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:31.620
Maybe you want to significantly decrease your

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:38.520
risk of memory disorders and feel how your
brain is being supercharged and regenerated...in

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:45.520
which case it could take at least 75 days
to treat the deterioration caused by the damaged

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.330
brain networks…which means 3 bottles of
Neurocalm Pro…

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:58.200
Or- and this is a popular choice among the
people who contact us- you want the best chances

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:05.380
against memory loss or other brain disorders,
while treating tinnitus… in which case 6

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:10.220
months and 6 bottles of Neurocalm Pro are
all you need..

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:15.310
We cannot estimate exactly how damaged your
brain networks are at this point.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:23.030
This depends on many factors, such as how
old your tinnitus is, your medical history,

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.560
your overall state of health and lifestyle
choices etc.

00:45:26.560 --> 00:45:34.460
So, as a rule of thumb, after seeing the positive
results of more than 47,000 people suffering

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:41.340
chronic tinnitus, we recommend to take at
the very least 3 bottles (6 bottles or more

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.680
to be completely safe), for a period of 90
days.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.960
This should be enough to completely regenerate
your brain, supercharge and protect it against

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:57.940
tinnitus and memory disorders.
It’s a fact since many people have confirmed

00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:01.820
the results with such dramatic success.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:07.030
Like Jeremy Seaton, 45, Pennsylvania
I’ve always said I’d cut off at least

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:13.150
three of my fingers for a magic pill that
banishes tinnitus and I’m sure I’m not

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:21.510
the only one… Actually seeing this sound
therapy and pill exists, it feels like a miracle…

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:26.300
My head is quieter than EVER, and I can't
even remember a time my whole body felt this

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.770
calm.
My mind is clear, the brain fog is gone…it’s

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:36.660
like I’ve suddenly got this special brain
power. And this is just the second month since

00:46:36.660 --> 00:46:42.070
I began taking the pills…I’m sharing this
with everyone I know, it’s the least I can

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:43.070
do.”

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:48.350
Sarah M., 58, Kentucky
I didn’t believe for a second in what you

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:54.730
were saying, Gerard. Just 15 minutes daily
of the sound therapy and 2 pills a day to

00:46:54.730 --> 00:47:00.970
end years of chronic tinnitus and keep your
brain safe from memory disorders? Please,

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:05.930
go bark up another tree...
It was my daughter the one who insisted I

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:12.650
take them, we argued a lot. It’s true what
they say…children are smarter than their

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:16.260
parents.
I had ringing in my left ear and a pulsing

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:23.820
sensation in my right ear all the time before
I started this incredible protocol…all gone

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:29.790
now. I still can’t believe it.
It’s like a curse has been lifted. I feel

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:31.690
blessed and alive.

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:39.280
Val T., 60, Detroit
I was stuck with hearing aids to stifle the

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.940
sounds. I could barely go through life each
day. But after a couple weeks of this therapy

00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:49.240
I threw them away.
My husband can't believe I understand everything

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:54.380
he says and can even answer questions from
another room.

00:47:54.380 --> 00:48:01.100
My headaches are gone and even though I always
forgot where I put my keys, I don’t anymore.

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:06.800
I also remember birthdays.  Used to fear
memory loss …not anymore.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:12.700
I’m happy my husband began to take these
pills too. He doesn’t have tinnitus, he

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:17.780
takes them for his brain. Everybody should.
I’m never giving them up.

00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:23.119
People are getting their lives and peace of
mind back as we speak…

00:48:23.119 --> 00:48:28.930
Using a completely natural and side effect
free revolutionary protocol…

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:35.200
And all it takes to quiet your mind is 15
minutes of your time and  2 pills a day.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:38.950
So, knowing all of this, it's obvious why

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:47.210
the Neurocalm Protocol dominates any other
option to successfully treat tinnitus... Nothing

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:52.820
else out there proved to WORK...
You could go to a doctor, who will torture

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:58.840
you with tons of useless tests or quickly
prescribe you expensive medicine that cause

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:04.840
dizziness, stomach problems and fatigue…
Medicine unproven to stop tinnitus because

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:11.510
it's not a bacterial infection or virus, but
a disease of the networks that connect the

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:15.410
brain...
Or maybe he'll talk you into an expensive

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:21.530
hearing aid to "cover up" the constant sound
waves exploding in your head...

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:28.119
Annoying and embarrassing to wear-and good
luck getting your insurance to cover the cost!

00:49:28.119 --> 00:49:35.369
Next, your doctor might try prescribing depression
meds and sleeping pills to deafen the depression

00:49:35.369 --> 00:49:41.460
and anxiety caused by tinnitus... but those
methods can't get to the root of the problem,

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:47.210
they're just addictive chemicals that turn
you into a zombie and prevent you from feeling

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:52.860
and experiencing life to its fullest.
There are alternative remedies like fake herbal

00:49:52.860 --> 00:50:00.230
extracts and acupuncture, even meditation
to calm down the extreme stress tinnitus causes...

00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:06.310
Which maybe doesn't hurt but surely is NOT
strong enough to be that treat-all you're

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:11.440
wishing for.
And then there’s sound therapy that is barely

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:16.400
worth mentioning.
All of these are a waste of time, energy and

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:22.900
money and you know it.
They won’t get you well in a million years…

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:28.810
Unlike the Neurocalm Protocol that can get
the job done in just a couple of weeks   while

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:32.340
keeping you safe from future brain disorders…

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:38.660
You can understand why I initially wanted
to set the value for one bottle of Neurocalm

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:43.080
Pro and the entire Neurocalm Protocol at $99.

00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:49.630
And, if you see this from my  point of view,
I’m sure you can understand why.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:57.240
I mean, once you go through the program—the
sound therapy recordings, 30-day kick start

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:01.980
kit, personalized progress charts, tinnitus
FAQ lists…

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:06.280
You could rebalance your brain to handle sounds

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:13.760
correctly… Shut down the ringing, roaring,
whooshing and blood pumping… Stop the headaches

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:16.390
and sleepless nights…

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:23.450
And if you pair this up with the unique Neurocalm
Pro supplement, you could rapidly restore

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:29.680
mental health as your mind quiets down and
adjusts to the real world of sound going on

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:34.030
around you…
Which, trust me, is beautiful… not painful

00:51:34.030 --> 00:51:40.060
or irritating, like it seems now.
Also, all the ingredients inside Neurocalm

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:45.330
Pro are natural, some of them quite rare and
hard to obtain...

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:51.670
Plus, this special formula is designed for
the root cause of tinnitus, which is a life-threatening

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:58.440
disease of your brain networks, one that could
eventually lead you to severe memory loss

00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:03.460
and even dementia.
Also, add on the costs of seeing a specialist

00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:09.010
in your area, including the diagnoses he’ll
make you pay for and the drugs he is going

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:10.780
to prescribe to you…

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:16.750
Well, given all of this, $99 should seem like
a TOTAL STEAL.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:24.250
But like I mentioned already, the Neurocalm
Protocol is not about us making a profit.

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:31.210
Sure, it would be nice to get paid for our
work and efforts but if we wanted money, we

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:38.510
could accept Big Pharma’s proposal right
now, close this page and get ourselves a bank

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:46.880
account ten times fatter than a Jackpot winner’s.
But we don't want their filthy money. All

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:53.369
we want is to help you and people like you
get truly better. That’s what my story and

00:52:53.369 --> 00:52:59.650
mission meant from the start.
I wish this miraculous sound therapy and miraculous

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:06.730
pills protocol existed before the doctors
cut my ear off my had to “fix” my tinnitus,

00:53:06.730 --> 00:53:13.000
traumatizing me for life…
But the past can’t be changed and what

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.970
matters now is that, after receiving emails
from people who can't afford the Neurocalm

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:25.520
Protocol, we knew we had to find a way so
EVERYONE could afford it…

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:31.640
Which is why there’s no chance I could consider
charging you $99 for this.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:37.910
And because you’re watching this presentation,
you will benefit from a discount for Neurocalm

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:41.220
Pro from our awareness campaign...

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:47.340

allowed thousands of people to finally hit

For only $69

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:10.450
But you know what?
I'm going to make the deal even sweeter.

00:54:10.450 --> 00:54:17.511
Because I know how hard it is to live paralyzed
by that hellish sound day after day, and night

00:54:17.511 --> 00:54:19.000
after night…

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:26.280
I want people to have what I now have… And
I want to get this program out to as many

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.800
people as possible in order to accomplish
that… So I’m not bothering with profits.

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:41.730
That’s why I've set up a discounted package
system of 6 bottles of Neurocalm Pro and the

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:50.150
sound therapy protocol for you, for only $49

offered TODAY ONLY... for as long as supplies
last. You also get free shipping on us.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:05.140
But because this unique protocol works best
only together with Neurocalm Pro, once we

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:11.530
run out of bottles, the "BUY NOW" buttons
will not be active anymore until we make another

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:16.770
batch again (which takes around 2-3 months
at least).

00:55:16.770 --> 00:55:24.230
Click the 6-bottle package (or any other package
that you want) below to secure your order.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:27.220
Consider this the smallest, but most powerful

investment that you have ever made for yourself!

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:38.550
Yes, the sound therapy program and 1 bottle
of Neurocalm Pro might shut down the ringing,

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:45.610
roaring, whooshing and blood pumping sounds…
3 bottles might be enough to rapidly restore

00:55:45.610 --> 00:55:52.520
your mental health, help with brain cells
rejuvenation by 15 years or more while getting

00:55:52.520 --> 00:56:02.410
you rid of migraines, insomnia and brain shrinkage…
But 6 bottles of Neurocalm Pro and the unique

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:08.830
sound therapy program could make your brain
immune not only to tinnitus, but to memory

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:17.030
loss, amnesia and dementia …just imagine
being independent and free from old age problems!

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:22.869
You could turn 102- years old and your mind
would still be sharp as a tack!

00:56:22.869 --> 00:56:27.490
You may be saying,
“OK, this sounds amazing and I'm interested!

00:56:27.490 --> 00:56:30.480
How do I get started?”

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:36.690

You can access the program immediately and

00:57:39.690 --> 00:57:45.880
after just one listening session…
You
can trust in what the sound technologists

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:51.390
and scientific researchers have discovered…
That your brain can be swiftly re-trained

00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:59.240
to operate its inner sound system NORMALLY
again… That this sound therapy program is

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:05.090
the ONLY internal dial that turns tinnitus
ALL the way down.

00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:11.210
And if you pair this with the ground-breaking
Neurocalm Pro, you can see for yourself how

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:18.119
your ringing becomes less and less intense
until it eventually vanishes... how your anxiety

and panic attacks fade away... and how you
are finally surrounded by silence again..

00:58:25.450 --> 00:58:30.600
Just like our more than 47,000 satisfied customers

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:37.900
If you're unsatisfied for any reason (it's
rare but just in case) send us an email in

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:43.120

this is a 100% risk-free investment. So click
one of the buttons below to get started on

00:58:57.370 --> 00:59:00.760
your journey of becoming tinnitus free.

00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:11.950
But please, know you really do have to act
now. We are offering the Neurocalm Protocol

00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:19.110
for just $69, and even cheaper if you are
getting our more popular packages, just to

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:24.400
get this amazing program into more hands.
But we are planning on raising the price back

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:31.359
to $99, or possibly much higher in the future.
Because here's the weird thing. When I tell

00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:37.100
people that you can easily fight tinnitus
and from brain disorders…in practically

00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:44.650
no time and for less than a visit to a specialist...
well, most people think it’s unbelievable,

00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:52.740
as if there's something "fishy" going on.
It just sounds too cheap, especially if you

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:57.869
have been struggling to cure it with your
doctor's prescriptions or with who knows what

00:59:57.869 --> 01:00:03.670
other methods…
Our mission is to spread the Neurocalm Protocol

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:09.730
to as many people as humanly possible, and
the big dream is for tinnitus and brain disorders

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:14.430
to be a thing of the past!
But if people find it hard to believe that

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:20.570
you can get such incredible results for less
than the cost of a visit to a specialist,

01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:25.730
or a meal with your family at a restaurant,
then we'll have to raise the price.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:31.680
Not to mention we don’t know how much longer
we’ll be able to hide from Big Pharma’s

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.730
threats.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:40.550
But if this website is still up, it means
you can still get Neurocalm Protocol if you

01:00:40.550 --> 01:00:42.570
act now.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:47.920
Click to make your choice below, enter your
payment details, and place the order now.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:54.210
Neurocalm Pro will arrive at your doorstep
in a matter of days.
Also, you'll gain immediate

01:00:54.210 --> 01:01:01.070
access to the entire Neurocalm Protocol, the
30-Day Kick-start program, the “listening

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:09.530
session” charts and the sound therapy sessions
- which can be accessed right away from your

01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:16.210
computer, iPad or smartphone.
You can print,
download and listen to anything you want,

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:20.970
whenever you like.
Listen, when you think about it, you really

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:24.760
only have two choices ahead of you right now.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:30.930
Option one: Stop following this presentation
and leave this page. Do nothing. Keep going

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:36.760
the way you are now, with that crucifying
sound following you everywhere and risking

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:42.710
serious brain conditions.
Keep being frustrated that nothing works,

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:48.330
spend hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars
on useless therapies, live with your tinnitus

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:56.109
for the following months... maybe even years,
or decades. It's not going to be pleasant.

01:01:56.109 --> 01:02:03.650

01:02:28.569 --> 01:02:31.400
STILL HERE?
That's fine, this presentation covered so

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:34.690
much information that you might have some
questions.

01:02:34.690 --> 01:02:40.640
So I’ll just take a moment to answer a few
questions that are usually asked by clients

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:44.300
before choosing the Neurocalm Protocol...

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:50.140
Question 1: How does the Neurocalm Protocol
work? Can you explain it again?

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:57.450
The Neurocalm Protocol is a revolutionary
2 step program to terminate tinnitus once

01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:58.859
and for all:

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:04.670
First, the sound therapy techniques inside
this program will “unplug” your brain

01:03:04.670 --> 01:03:12.680
from its internal loud speakers just by LISTENING...
simply and with no effort on your part.
Secondly,

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:19.040
the Neurocalm Pro supplement, which is absolutely
crucial to repair your brain networks damaged

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.880
by tinnitus and calm down your nervous system.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.880


01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:29.970
3. What am I getting inside the Neurocalm
Sound therapy protocol?

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:32.940
The techniques inside this program are represented

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.680
in a simple and easy format for anyone who
might want to use them. You’ll fill out

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:46.640
an initial evaluation questionnaire for tinnitus
to gauge severity for an individual recommendation

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:49.480
on which sound recordings work best.

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:55.440
In the 30-Day kick-start program, you’ll
receive “listening session” charts and

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.200
times, including weekly report forms for tracking
your progress. You’ll get a categorized

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:07.690
list of all the sound therapy sessions based
on what part of the brain they work on, with

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:13.180
technical breakdowns for how the sounds have
been altered or enhanced for maximum potency.

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.859
Lastly, you’ll receive a general FAQ list

01:04:16.859 --> 01:04:23.840
for tinnitus and how it disrupts the ear canals,
as well as known causes for the disease and

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:31.009
suspected culprits… plus a general  “How
To” section to help you protect your hearing.

01:04:31.009 --> 01:04:33.660
Combined altogether, the techniques inside

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:40.780
this program “unplug” your brain from
its internal loud speakers just by listening—simply

01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:43.630
and with no effort on your part.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:48.750
4. How does the Neurocalm Pro supplement
work ?

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:55.210
Scientists discovered that tinnitus goes way
beyond than just the annoying, non-stop ear-ringing.

01:04:55.210 --> 01:05:00.050
In fact, tinnitus is just a signal of brain
networks getting destroyed.

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:06.070
Unfortunately, memory loss, dementia and so
many other memory disorders start with the

01:05:06.070 --> 01:05:12.900
failure of brain networks. To put it simply:
Your brain is a ticking time-bomb and tinnitus

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.590
is the emergency alert.
Now, the supplement works in the following

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:18.590
way:

01:05:18.590 --> 01:05:25.220
STEP 1: Your hearing begins to clear as the
brain networks are getting repaired and the

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:30.990
nervous system calmed down.
The “buzzing” brain networks are quickly

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:38.930
fixed and the intensity of tinnitus sounds
being to lower in the first few days.

01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:45.840
STEP 2: You regain your quiet mind while your
brain networks are strengthening and becoming

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:51.440
indestructible.
Tinnitus is attacked out by the incredibly

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.140
strong brain connections.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:06:01.620
STEP 3: You feel your memory stronger than
ever while your damaged brain cells are quickly

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:07.540
being repaired.
Wiping out years of brain deterioration resulted

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.420
from the “broken” networks.

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:16.310
STEP 4: You feel your brain supercharged while
cell regenerations begins.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:23.859
The “tinnitus” brain that made you a vegetable
is now being rejuvenated: you think faster,

01:06:23.859 --> 01:06:29.350
better, clearer. It’s like your brain is
on steroids.

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:35.990
STEP 5: Not worrying anymore about tinnitus
and brain disorders because your brain is

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:42.590
being trained for a perfect health.
Your brain is being cleaned of toxins and

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:48.360
plaque, your neural connections are multiplying,
while a shield against tinnitus and memory

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.210
loss is being created.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:57.609
Question 2: Can I take Neurocalm Pro even
if I have allergies or if I currently use

01:06:57.609 --> 01:07:02.780
other supplements?
We created this amazing anti-tinnitus weapon

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:09.530
so that it has no damaging effect on people
who have various allergies, as the quantities

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:15.580
of the ingredients inside are selected to
be below the allergy-triggering levels.

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:22.570
But we recommend that, if you have any known
allergies to one of the mentioned pill ingredients,

01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:27.090
you do not take this supplement.
For more details, please check the Disclaimer

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:29.589
link at the bottom of this page.

01:07:29.589 --> 01:07:33.980
Question 3: Why haven't I heard of this protocol
before?

01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:40.760
Well, as I explained during the presentation,
tinnitus and memory loss drug industry is

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:47.690
a $25 billion- a-year industry business.
But what the general public is unaware of

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:54.950
is that the drug industry literally spends
millions and millions of dollars each year

01:07:54.950 --> 01:08:01.369
to ensure that academic medicine focuses only
on the drugs that make industry money, and

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:04.960
not on the drugs that will actually help people
get better.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:12.810
Question 4: Is this program for everyone?
Yes! It could work successfully and safely

01:08:12.810 --> 01:08:20.230
for people of any age. The sound therapy techniques
are non-invasive, relaxing and retrain your

01:08:20.230 --> 01:08:26.920
brain to quickly and effortlessly silence
tinnitus—giving your ears and mind the relief

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:33.569
to achieve anything you want while feeling
amazing in the process.
At the same time

01:08:33.569 --> 01:08:41.560
Neurocalm Pro is safe for people of any age,
non-invasive and risk-free. It works by helping

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:48.420
your damaged brain networks to quickly and
effortlessly fight tinnitus, giving your mind

01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:54.640
the relief to achieve anything you want while
feeling amazing in the process.

01:08:54.640 --> 01:09:00.980
This program has also proved to be successful
for people with early onset of memory loss.

01:09:00.980 --> 01:09:07.790
This is not unusual, since Neurocalm Pro was
designed to also rejuvenate brain cells. As

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:13.969
I told you before, tinnitus is just an emergency
alert that announces something’s wrong deep

01:09:13.969 --> 01:09:20.420
inside in your brain. Dealing with the root
cause of tinnitus means dealing with any existing

01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:22.190
brain damage.

01:09:22.190 --> 01:09:28.500
Question 5: What happens once I click one
of the options below?

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:36.390

in just a couple of days.
It's that easy.

01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.070
Question 6: How long does it really take

01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:10.360
to see results?
As I've told you, and I'm very proud to repeat

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:17.910
this, you'll see the results amazingly fast.
As soon as you begin the sound therapy program,

01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:23.620
the battle against tinnitus is half won! In
no time your tinnitus will become less and

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:30.910
less intense until it will eventually surrender
to silence. This, coupled with the Neurocalm

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:37.219
Pro supplement, will ensure that your brain
networks damage will be repaired and your

01:10:37.219 --> 01:10:39.670
nervous system will calm down.

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:46.350
Question 7: What are the terms of that guarantee
that you've mentioned?

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:52.010
Because I want you to feel completely confident
in your investment today, I'm providing you

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:58.260
with a 60-day money back guarantee.
Simply click one of the buttons below, and

01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:02.320
try the program out yourself for the next
60 days.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:09.321
If you don't get the results I promised in
the shorterst amount of time possible... or

01:11:09.321 --> 01:11:15.620
you're unsatisfied for any reason... simply
send an email to us in the Members' Area,

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:20.560
and I'll give you your money back. No questions
asked.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:25.510
It should be clear that if I thought this
wasn't going to work, there's no way I would

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:32.110
make such an offer. But I do know this will
work... a total of more than 47,000 people

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:34.500
have already proven it.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:39.330
Question 8: How long will this program be
available to the public?

01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:45.280
Well, I'm not really sure, but history has
shown us that Big Pharma is not afraid to

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:52.280
spend millions of dollars in legal fees to
remove something that threatens its very existence.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:57.590
If you think about it, that makes sense. Wouldn't
you spend 1 million dollars in lawyer costs

01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:04.690
to protect the $25 billion per year you make?
In other words, if you are truly serious about

01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:09.320
fighting your tinnitus and protecting your
brain against memory disorders in the following

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:13.270
days, you need to take action immediately.

01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:21.800
Question 9: How do I get the Neurocalm Protocol?
This one is easy: Simply choose your package

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.800
by clicking on one of the options below, and
try out the entire program for yourself, for

01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:36.070
60 days, with absolutely no risk. If you are
unhappy for any reason, you'll be given a

01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:39.910
prompt refund, no questions asked...

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:46.630
That being said, I am supremely confident
you won't be asking for a refund because this

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:52.630
program has been proven to be effective for
anyone suffering from tinnitus... even if

01:12:52.630 --> 01:12:58.670
they’ve had it for 10, or 20 years.
So click below. Fill in your payment details
