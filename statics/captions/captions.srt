00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:09,609
Hi, my name is Thomas Spear and one year ago
I almost choked to death on a tooth that fell

2
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,411
while I was asleep…

3
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:15,749
I was all alone in the dark bedroom…
With no one in the world to help me…

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:19,519
Hopelessly trying to gasp for air again and
again and again…

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,022
Until finally… somebody up there must have
really loved me…

6
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,593
I coughed… I coughed blood all over the
sheets and pillows…

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:30,096
And one tooth…
I never- not even in a thousand years –would

8
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:34,033
have thought such a thing is even possible…
But even though it was the most terrifying

9
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:38,071
experience from my entire life…
It was that precise nightmarish moment that

10
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:43,042
sent me on a completely unexpected journey
that opened my eyes to the sick and deadly

11
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,913
practices of the dental industry...
Helped me find out what’s really happening

12
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:51,084
inside the body when your gums are bleeding…
And eventually lead me to the discovery of

13
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:55,588
a completely natural and inexpensive method
that makes it possible for you to effortlessly

14
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:59,192
regenerate all your gums…
While super-cementing your teeth no matter

15
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:03,563
how advanced your tooth decay is...
In the following 5 minutes, I’ll show you

16
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,831
why…

17
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:08,802
Gum disease, tooth decay or bad breath
have nothing to do with how good your oral

18
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,437
hygiene is…

19
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:14,808
But with predatory bacteria buried deep inside
your gums, eating at your roots and spreading

20
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:19,779
like a plague to your throat, nose and airways…
And, no matter what your doctor tells you,

21
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:23,516
not even the deepest cleaning treatments can
reach and destroy these bacteria that are

22
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:27,387
tirelessly lurking inside your mouth even
when your teeth seem fine….

23
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:30,957
But, once you'll find out what you can do
about it, not only will you have the power

24
00:01:30,957 --> 00:01:35,328
to get rid of your bleeding gums, bad teeth
and bad breath once and for all…

25
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,232
But you’ll also never have to face a dentist
for horrifying procedures again…

26
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:43,336
Because this solution is so simple that you
can use it right now in your own home in less

27
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,307
than 60 seconds…
And so incredibly powerful that it has been

28
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:52,011
clinically proven to work regardless of your
age, medical condition or the severity of

29
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:55,615
your tooth decay…
Without you having to spend a single red cent

30
00:01:55,615 --> 00:02:01,955
on endless dental treatments, dangerous chemical-filled
medications... painful tartar removal, risky

31
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,758
surgeries, or implants.
In fact, this cheap method is so amazing...

32
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,095
That not only did it send shockwaves across
the medical establishment...

33
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:13,133
But many doctors see it as a miraculous key
that can unlock gum and teeth rejuvenation…

34
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:17,704
Yes, I know how incredible this sounds...
especially if you've been suffering from tooth

35
00:02:17,704 --> 00:02:21,708
decay and terrible pain thinking there's NO
escape whatsoever...

36
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,311
But even if your dentist has crushed your
hopes by saying that “it’s too late”,

37
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:29,816
that you're bound to throw all your hard-earned
savings on teeth reconstruction and implants….

38
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:33,052
It's crucial that you stick with me until
the very end of my story, because in a few

39
00:02:33,052 --> 00:02:35,922
moments....
You'll soon be able to save your teeth and

40
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,858
smile with confidence once again.
Just imagine…

41
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:43,763
No more throbbing pain, no more inflamed,
bleeding gums and bad breath…

42
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:48,301
No more risking serious infections or stuffing
yourself with medications hoping the pulsating

43
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:54,774
tooth agony will stop for just one second…
Never having to cover your mouth or feel embarrassed…

44
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,677
Instead eating whatever you want, whenever
you want…

45
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:02,081
Talking, smiling and taking pride in showing
your pearly whites….

46
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:06,052
Being able to kiss your wife or your kids
without seeing them turning their heads away…

47
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:09,455
And never ever having to set foot in a dental
office again.

48
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:12,892
Just like 57,000 other people did. People
like…

49
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:18,131
Nicolas C.J., 45 y. o., from Glendale, Arizona,
who wrote to say:

50
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,135
“I have always taken care of my teeth and
just couldn’t understand why my gums were

51
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:26,839
red, swollen and receding.
My dentist recommended me tartar removal,

52
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:31,344
it was awful, still hurts when I think about
that scaler digging under my gums. Not to

53
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,247
mention it didn’t help at all and one tooth
got loose.

54
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:38,718
Didn’t really believe in your method but
tried it anyway because I was desperate. It’s

55
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:43,623
like my gums have grown back. My teeth seem
whiter too. Thank you for this, never going

56
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,558
back to the doctor again!”

57
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,729
Or Kimberly M., 51 y. o., from Chicago, Illinois,
who says:

58
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,234
“Thomas, God bless you! I was sick with
worry over my teeth. I was spitting blood

59
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:58,771
every time I brushed and one of my front teeth
seemed to be moving. I hate dentists and I

60
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:03,376
sure didn’t have money for an implant. Now
everything is fine, gums are clean and healthy,

61
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:06,946
and no more loose teeth.”
Those are just two of the real life stories

62
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:11,951
from people just like you, who have already
used the method I'm about to share with you.

63
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:15,188
Now I'll give you all the details on how it
works in just a second.

64
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,824
But before I do, I want you to know who I
am…

65
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:22,161
Why my unusual discovery turned the dental
industry upside down while saving thousands

66
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:26,933
of people the pain and money of going through
implants and sickening dental procedures....

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,104
And how exactly it will help you rebuild your
teeth and gums in 60 seconds before going

68
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,841
to bed - even in the most severe of cases
of tooth decay.

69
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:39,746
So, as you know, my name is Thomas Spear.
I’m 52 years old and I live in a small town

70
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,782
near San Francisco, California, with my wife,
Hannah.

71
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:47,654
I’ve been a chemistry teacher for the past
30 years and, in the past 5 years, since my

72
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:52,191
wife had to retire early due to an accident,
I’ve also been working as a taxi driver.

73
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:55,528
Life’s never been too easy for me but I
don’t complain.

74
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:59,866
In fact, as you’re about to see, had it
not been for my two jobs, I wouldn’t have

75
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:05,171
come across the groundbreaking solution that
is now changing the lives of so many people…

76
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:09,442
You see, after getting my second job as a
taxi driver, I started working long hours,

77
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:14,113
especially at night, fuelling up on coffee
and sweets to stay awake or just find the

78
00:05:14,113 --> 00:05:17,650
energy to carry on.
At first, I used to carry a toothbrush in

79
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:22,021
my glovebox and wash my teeth in gas stations
but after a while I was just too exhausted

80
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:26,292
for that.
Few months later, my gums started bleeding…

81
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,562
First time, I noticed the toothpaste I spit
out turned slightly pink...

82
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,366
Then, each time I got to brush my teeth, I
spitted out blood in the sink.

83
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,303
No big deal, I thought, I have more important
things to worry about.

84
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:40,273
A little bleeding from brushing can happen
to anyone,

85
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:44,510
nothing wrong with that, right?
Wrong, spitting out blood after brushing is

86
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,511
dead wrong...

87
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,848
It’s true, it happens to more people than
you think…

88
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,353
A whopping 56% of Americans suffer from some
form of gum disease…

89
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,924
But this does not make it any less serious…
You’re about to see inside this presentation

90
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,926
why you should never ignore this sign.

91
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:02,528
So, not long after, something embarrassing
happened.

92
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,666
At school, the other teachers kept turning
their heads away when I was talking to them…

93
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:11,037
Or just made a step back to keep a distance…
And once I’ve even overheard a few of my

94
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,574
students calling me “Beetlejuice”.
If you don’t know who that is…well, it’s

95
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,976
a movie character with rotten, horrible teeth…

96
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,977
When I heard them…
I just wished the ground would open and swallow

97
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:18,978
me.

98
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:19,979
I went to the bathroom and looked at my teeth
in the mirror.

99
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,917
Yellow, with swollen and irritated gums.
And as hard as it was to admit…

100
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,587
It was my breath that kept driving everybody
away.

101
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:31,591
Which explained why Hannah kept avoiding kissing
me or even hugging me.

102
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,761
But what really hurt like hell, was when I
wanted to take my granddaughter, Sarah, into

103
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:39,766
my arms, and she started crying:
“I don’t wanna! You make me vomit!”

104
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:43,136
Still, the worst was yet to come.
Pain.

105
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:48,441
Terrible, never ending, pulsating pain, even
after popping painkillers like Tic-Tacs.

106
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,477
I was always moody.
Always tired.

107
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:56,048
Avoided to talk to people as much as I could.
And on top of everything, my upper left molar

108
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:59,685
seemed to be moving.
It felt like in one of those bad dreams when,

109
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,790
you know, your teeth are falling…only it
was really happening…

110
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,194
My wife kept bugging me to go to the dentist.
On one side, I knew she was right, on the

111
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,031
other side…I kept postponing it…. and
eating only on the left side.

112
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,268
Listen, I’m a 6-foot tall man and I know
how this sounds…

113
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,839
But I’d rather pet a venomous, hairy, giant
tarantula than go to the dentist.

114
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,509
I get cold shivers up my spine just when thinking
about it…

115
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,613
The gruesome smells, the gut wrenching instruments.
But then…

116
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,415
The dreadful night came.

117
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:33,719
Hannah was babysitting our granddaughter,
so she was spending the night at our son’s

118
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,088
house.
I had a free shift so I was happy to get into

119
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:40,626
bed and finally get some sleep…
All seemed to be just fine, my gums weren’t

120
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,296
swollen anymore so I fell asleep with a glimpse
of hope…

121
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:47,400
…And got brutally woken up.
I’ll never forget the time: 12:47.

122
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,438
Choking, unable to breath, not knowing what
was stuck in my throat.

123
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:57,076
Hopelessly staring at the clock on the nightstand…
A minute that felt like eternity: from 12:47

124
00:07:57,076 --> 00:08:01,514
to 12:48.
Then coughing up all the blood…and the molar.

125
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,616
I was sick to my stomach when I saw all the
mess.

126
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,520
Sick to my stomach when I thought I almost
died, choking on a tooth in my sleep.

127
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,958
The next morning, my cheek was swollen.
After hearing all that had happened to me

128
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,760
and seeing the way I looked, Hannah was worried
sick.

129
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,431
So, I knew I had no choice: I had to go to
the dentist.

130
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:21,734
My heart was pounding out of my chest when
I entered the cabinet.

131
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:26,005
After a quick look into my mouth and an X-ray…
The dentist gave me 2 frightening news….

132
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,976
And, please, keep listening, especially if
you’ve ever dealt with bleeding gums…

133
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:34,981
One. My gums were so damaged that I had passed
right by gingivitis, and landed into the dangerous

134
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,850
land of periodontitis.

135
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,952
Periodontitis is an advanced form of gum disease
that begins

136
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:44,924
with inflammation and bleeding…and ultimately
causes your gums to retract, your teeth to

137
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,193
fall, plus bad breath and tooth decay.

138
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,630
Not only that but gum disease and periodontitis
are also linked to

139
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,935
respiratory infections, kidney disease and
even oral deadly diseases.

140
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,472
All because- as you’re about to see- it
turns your mouth into a perfect environment

141
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:04,110
for harmful bacteria to thrive in…
So, what was I supposed to do? Well, as the

142
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,111
doctor put it…

143
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,914
Here’s how much it would cost you to “fix”
your gums at the dentist

144
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,049
and what you would have to go through….

145
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:16,389
Gum grafts… about $600 per gum, no guarantee
it will work. If your gums are seriously damaged,

146
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,493
this could cost you up to thousands of dollars.
Fillings and root canals to “save” the

147
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:25,665
teeth that were already damaged, with prices
that range from $500 to $2000- that’s a

148
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,234
lot of money for a lot of pain if you ask
me!

149
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:33,306
Then there’s surgery to “strengthen the
gums” or, in medical terms, “pocket elimination

150
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:38,177
surgery”, costs approximately $6,000…
Or – my favourite one- remove the worst

151
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:42,915
teeth and replace them with implants.
Thinking an implant costs $4,500 – best

152
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:47,153
case scenario- and that, according to the
doctor- I needed at least 4, I might as well

153
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,454
have sold one of my kidneys!

154
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:53,092
Oh, but the list doesn’t stop here… no
matter the dental procedure you choose as

155
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:56,228
your torture…
Know that after you’ll have to pay for…maintenance,

156
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,565
which can cost over $100 per session.

157
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:05,071
To put it bluntly: expensive, lengthy, painful
treatments that promised no real solution...and

158
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,675
I assure you, no doctor could ever guarantee
you that any of those treatments would work.

159
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:15,548
It’s all a game of chance: only it’s your
money, your time and your health on the table.

160
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:17,083
For example…

161
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:19,986
Did you know that you have to wait for a year
and a half to know if your dental implant

162
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:24,490
is a success or not?
Implants are usually a two-part process — first

163
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,561
putting in the implant, then waiting for the
area to heal and covering it with a crown

164
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:34,033
six to 3-4 months later…
And then, only if 1 year passes without infections

165
00:10:34,033 --> 00:10:38,371
or other complications, can you finally breathe
a sigh of relief…

166
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:42,141
As if this depressing list wasn’t, the dentist
dropped the second bomb on me…

167
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:45,678
I needed surgery.
You see, my fallen tooth had a fractured root.

168
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:49,715
A piece of this root was still buried deep
inside my gums, causing an infection.

169
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:54,053
So, we needed to remove the remaining bits
and fast, before the infection was going to

170
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:57,590
spread even more.
As the doctor explained to me, a tooth infection

171
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,427
can “invade” your brain in a matter of
hours and lead to severe complications, and

172
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,231
even death.
Why? Because each one of your teeth is connected

173
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:09,168
to your brain through tiny nerves.
The infection can travel from the tooth to

174
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,302
the nose…to the eyes…and ultimately to
the brain.

175
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:15,741
Here’s how to tell if your infection
needs immediate medical attention

176
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:20,880
(1 tip I learned from the doctor)
If you experience confusion, headaches and

177
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,183
fever, you need to go to the hospital right
away.

178
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,287
As for my surgery, I’ll spare you the details.
Let’s just say getting stung with a big

179
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:32,525
anesthetic needle in your gums 5 times in
a row and then butchered for one hour straight

180
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,094
isn’t something you want to remember.

181
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:38,931
The most horrifying thing, however, was that,
even after the anesthetic from the surgery

182
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:42,034
was gone…
I couldn’t feel my chin and my mouth was

183
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,035
a little crooked.

184
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:47,039
It took me one month to recover and regain
the senses in my numb face.

185
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,311
Meanwhile I did a lot of research online to
see if anybody else had been in my situation…

186
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:56,882
Besides the only good advice I read… take
B vitamins for facial nerve recovery and pray

187
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,685
to God…
I came across a study that shattered me to

188
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,155
the core.
Dental procedures and surgeries- implants

189
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,324
included, can leave you disfigured.

190
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:09,061
No wonder they have you sign tons of consent
forms before the implant!

191
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,864
Anything to cover their backs in case something
goes wrong…

192
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,434
So, I could consider myself “a fortunate
case”.

193
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:19,905
After all these, one thing was sure: I was
never going back to the dentist again!

194
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:24,877
I started using a special toothpaste for gum
disease but with no success whatsoever…

195
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:29,381
I was afraid to chew, always checking my teeth
with my tongue to see if everything is fine…

196
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:35,287
I began eating mostly soups and mashed potatoes…
Until one day, it happened again:

197
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,623
One of my front teeth was moving.

198
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:42,661
That night I couldn’t sleep. I was paralyzed
with fear. And tormented by thoughts.

199
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:46,999
I was a full-grown man eating baby food
on his way to lose its front teeth, with no

200
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:50,503
money for implants,
and risking life-threatening infections.

201
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,874
That’s when I took the decision to take
the matter into my own hands and find a solution

202
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:59,044
that I could afford. Go to the end of the
earth if I had to. I couldn’t possibly live

203
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,348
like that.
So, I took some time off from teaching…which,

204
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:06,452
frankly, was a relief as I was too embarrassed
about my bad breath and bleeding gums to face

205
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,488
my colleagues…
And began spending my days in the biggest

206
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:13,125
library in San Francisco, searching every
corner…

207
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,695
As you can imagine, it was not easy... And
I can't tell you how many times I almost gave

208
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:17,696
up...

209
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:22,601
Well, there sure is a higher power out there,
because barely 3 weeks later, I FINALLY found

210
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,703
the one thing that changed everything...

211
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:29,475
That would end up giving me and over 57,000
other people just like yourself their good,

212
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,743
strong teeth and gums back.

213
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:35,381
Now, here’s what exactly happens inside
your mouth when you have gum disease…

214
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,818
It all starts with these dangerous bacteria
lurking deep inside your gums…

215
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:43,222
The bacteria are like small termites that
are relentlessly chewing on your teeth and

216
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:47,993
gums, leaving them bleeding and inflamed.
You might’ve gotten the bacteria from food,

217
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,530
water, or even from kissing or drinking after
somebody else.

218
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,402
In time, the bacteria, along with food debris,
multiply, accumulate and form the so-called

219
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,639
plaque and calculus.
The calculus/plaque is like a toxic mould

220
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,977
that spreads on your teeth walls, causing
bad breath and providing an “excellent”

221
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,780
home for the bacteria to thrive in.

222
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,917
Most of the times, your body’s natural defence
system succeeds in healing the swelling. But

223
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:16,288
there’s a catch to it: scars remain.
This means that, after every inflammation

224
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:19,758
episode, your gums retract.
Ultimately, they are too weak or too loose

225
00:14:19,758 --> 00:14:21,427
to hold your teeth.

226
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,562
Not only that but another disturbing thing
happens…

227
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,899
(and you need to take action fast)

228
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,469
The next numbers are nothing less than frightening
but the good news is there’s a simple way

229
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,639
out of all of these and you’re going to
discover it soon.

230
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,741
According to a study conducted by the University
of Michigan…

231
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:40,813
There are 20 billion bacteria in your mouth.
These bacteria reproduce every 5 hours.

232
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:45,818
If you go 24 hours without cleaning your teeth
- and I’m going to show you the MOST efficient

233
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:51,624
way to clean your teeth inside this presentation-…
Those 20 billion become 100 billion!

234
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,960
And after they feed on your gums…
They start devouring the ligaments that hold

235
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,731
your teeth and supports the bones.
Your teeth loosen…

236
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,834
The roots get fractured…
And it’s only a matter of time until you’ll

237
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:04,670
face infections, throbbing pain and tooth
decay.

238
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:09,008
If you’re thinking –as I did back then-
all you have to do is “clean” your mouth

239
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:13,679
of bacteria…think again.
Here’s what I discovered next:

240
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,715
No dental or medical method
can destroy the gum-eating bacteria

241
00:15:16,715 --> 00:15:19,585
(and here’s why)

242
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,488
This is not something you’re going to hear
from your dentist because they have no interest

243
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,891
in you knowing this.
Normally, doctors recommend brushing your

244
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:30,296
teeth at least twice a day, flossing or going
through dental scaling procedures to get rid

245
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:34,133
of the bacteria and tartar…
But here’s where it all goes wrong….

246
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:38,570
No matter how well you clean your teeth, at
least 10% of the bacteria will remain hidden

247
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,273
inside the “gum pockets”.
Why?

248
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,311
Because no traditional or advanced dental
cleaning method can reach that deep…

249
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:49,481
Electronic toothbrushes don’t stand a chance
of removing the teeth-eating bacteria as they

250
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,686
only deal with the surface of the teeth.
Dental floss might be good to clean the dental

251
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,856
debris but is very aggressive on your already
inflamed gums...

252
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:01,727
Mouthwash might cover the entire area and
go deeper under the gums but is not powerful

253
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:06,031
enough to break the plaque. Actually, all
it does is to attack your taste buds…

254
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,969
While dental scaling – the deepest method
of teeth cleaning- has to be done at least

255
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:15,541
once a week, often because the bacteria re-spreads
fast. But, if done too often, dental scaling

256
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:20,512
destroys the enamel. And without the enamel
protecting your tooth, you will scream with

257
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,081
pain, that I can guarantee.

258
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,185
Now, if your tooth falls, and you do have
the money for an implant and you’re also

259
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:29,922
lucky enough for the operation to be a success…guess
what?

260
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:33,959
The bacteria can always cause an infection
around the implant, resulting in inflammation

261
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,430
of the gums and, in the worst cases, leading
to bone loss in the jaw itself.

262
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,535
Plus, note that even if a tooth looks perfect
at the surface, the remaining 10% of bacteria

263
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,739
are still chewing on its roots.
Moreover…

264
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,442
Every time you do one of the following things,
the bacteria become even more resistant

265
00:16:50,442 --> 00:16:55,814
1. Eating hard food. Yes, I know how that
sounds. But every time you take a bite, the

266
00:16:55,814 --> 00:17:00,352
bacteria go even deeper. Why? Because you
put an incredible amount of pressure on your

267
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:05,491
teeth- up to 141 pounds!- therefore “sheltering
” the colony of termites deep inside the

268
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:09,061
gums.
2. Same thing happens at night if you’re

269
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:13,999
grinding your teeth. Chances you’re doing
during your sleep are very high as up to 50%

270
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:18,137
of Americans suffer from this condition, yet
few are aware of it.

271
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:22,341
So, what in the world could be powerful enough
to reach the bacteria, destroy it for good

272
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,876
and clean the plaque?

273
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,912
I was stuck. But not for long.

274
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,149
As I met one of the most respected medical
researchers:

275
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:34,053
Doctor S. T.
I’m using just his initials, to protect

276
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,122
his identity...
Anyway, S.T. came every morning into the library

277
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:41,894
and read tons of books on plants and herbs.
His smile was so perfect that I couldn’t

278
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,996
help but stare every single time he greeted
us.

279
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:49,101
One time I just couldn’t refrain myself:
“I’m sorry to bother you, but I couldn’t

280
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,904
not notice your teeth. I bet you had a lot
of work done…”

281
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,040
“Actually, none at all.”
So, we got to talking.

282
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,044
Dr. S.T. was retired for the past 2 years
and if he was to say the one thing he had

283
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:04,416
learned in all his 40 years of medical research
was that: plants were far superior to drugs.

284
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,786
His impeccable teeth were actually the result
of a homemade, soft “bubble gum” that

285
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:12,791
he’d been chewing on every morning.
Hearing all these, I began sharing my story.

286
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:17,229
The terrible night I almost choked to death
on my tooth, my gum disease and all the embarrassment

287
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:22,034
and pain it had caused me, the surgery…
And what I had discovered about the indestructible,

288
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,002
termite-bacteria…
“You know…”

289
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:28,106
Dr. S.T. said, after listening carefully to
my every word…

290
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:31,610
There’s one and only one thing that reaches
every corner of your mouth and goes under

291
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,513
your gums:
your saliva.

292
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:38,450
Seeing that I didn’t quite understand what
he was explaining, S.T. continued...

293
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,854
“The most important role of your saliva
is to protect your teeth and gums. That’s

294
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:45,791
why it has antibacterial properties and contains
lots of minerals and proteins.

295
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,862
That’s why the saliva is designed by nature
to reach every corner of your mouth and go

296
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:53,899
deep under your gums.
Meaning it has access- so to say- to all the

297
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:57,736
places where the bacteria thrive.
The only problem is…its power is limited.

298
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:01,640
And, without any help, it can’t possibly
break all the tartar or fight millions of

299
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,542
multiplying bacteria by itself.

300
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:05,677
Then, it hit me.

301
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,780
The solution:
turning saliva into the most powerful disinfectant

302
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,517
that would
break the tartar and destroy all the termite-bacteria.

303
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,552
But how?

304
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:16,355
After giving it some thought, S.T. came to
my rescue once again.

305
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:21,293
In his 40 years of medical research he had
seen certain herbs, plants and minerals 4

306
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:25,664
times stronger than morphine that could erase
migraines and tooth abscess pain…

307
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:30,969
Or anti-bacterial nutrients that made canker
sores outbreaks vanish in hours while forcing

308
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,840
the affected tissues to regenerate by the
next day…

309
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,443
The only thing was to find the right herbs,
plants & minerals that would perfectly mix

310
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:43,415
with the saliva and turn it into a strong
weapon against the termite-bacteria.

311
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:47,553
By now, you must be very curious and anxious
to find out what this ultimate teeth rejuvenation

312
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:51,223
solution contains...
Why it’s so extremely powerful that not

313
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:55,527
only does it fiercely fight gum disease and
tooth decay but it also starts the rebuilding

314
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,965
and rejuvenation of your teeth while protecting
you against other conditions, like cavities

315
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,569
and bad breath…
And, most importantly...

316
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,905
How does it work and why does it work
so incredibly well?

317
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,242
Please pay very close attention, because we
didn’t just discover a “trick” that

318
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,779
repairs your gums and teeth…
But something so incredibly powerful, that

319
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:18,917
not even Dr. S.T. believed to be possible…
And now, for the first time ever, we can share

320
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:23,322
the breakthrough secret of how this unique,
teeth-fortifying solution works:

321
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:28,427
We sourced a total of over 29 top ingredients
only from the purest locations, such as the

322
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:33,131
Alps mountains of Europe, the fertile plains
of India and western China, and from the best

323
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,702
plantations in South Africa, Ethiopia and
Kenya.

324
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:41,306
Moreover, after intensive lab testing, all
the powerful herbs, plants and minerals used

325
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:46,745
have proven to be 100% effective ONLY in this
formula, specifically calculated and adjusted

326
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:51,717
to be absorbed by your body, treating you
from the inside, and to supercharge your saliva,

327
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,086
making this ultimate dental weapon:

328
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:58,056
The FIRST STEP is to break the existing plaque
and tartar that have been loosening your gums

329
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:01,760
and creating a comfortable environment for
the termite-bacteria.

330
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,931
After more than 79 trials and experiments,
we have found out that the most effective

331
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,101
and fast way to do this was with the help
of Berberine.

332
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:15,240
This powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
herb has been shown to fight harmful microorganisms,

333
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,045
including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.

334
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,948
And since there are no side effects, Dr S.T.
said :

335
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:27,619
“It’s one ingredient and everyone both
under 40 or over should take - as the effects

336
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,721
are nothing short of a miracle.”

337
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:34,626
But because this is a very important teeth-rejuvenating
step, we added 2 more ingredients:

338
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:39,631
Turmeric - which is a well known antimicrobial
herb, proven to help remove plaque, bacteria,

339
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:44,636
and inflammation sometimes even more effective
than expensive traditional mouthwashes.

340
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,540
And Milk Thistle, which has been shown to
help treat damage to the liver caused by heavy

341
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,443
metals such as mercury, arsenic, cadmium,
and lead.

342
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:55,213
Why is that important?
Well, the answer is pretty simple: heavy metal

343
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:59,985
toxicity is a very serious issue, causing
even brain damage and most people are not

344
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:04,523
aware of this - but amalgam dental fillings
can contain up to 50% mercury.

345
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:08,527
That’s why Milk Thistle plays a very important
role in cleaning up and detoxifying your mouth

346
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:11,329
and body from these toxic metals.

347
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:15,067
The SECOND STEP is to locate the bacteria
colonies and destroy them by drowning them

348
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:19,604
in purifying substances that will also fight
the bleeding and inflammation.

349
00:22:19,604 --> 00:22:21,807
Sounds simple enough, but I can assure you
it’s not.

350
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:27,179
That’s why we came up with a powerful trio,
consisting of Artichoke, Chanca Piedra - a

351
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:33,051
herb Dr. S.T. especially sourced from the
rainforests of South America and Red Raspberry.

352
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:38,223
These three ingredients are loaded with vitamins
and minerals like vitamin C, vitamin K, folate,

353
00:22:38,223 --> 00:22:42,961
phosphorus, and magnesium, which act as essential
purifying agents and are especially important

354
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:44,996
for mouth infections.

355
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:49,434
The THIRD STEP - which is a crucial one, is
to tighten your loose gums, heal the wounds

356
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,570
and cement the teeth roots.

357
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,640
For this, we have used Yarrow - which, according
to the researchers from King's College London,

358
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:00,579
may increase fibroblasts, which are the cells
responsible for regenerating connective tissue

359
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:05,183
and helping your body recover from injury.
The second ingredient used to heal the wounds

360
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:08,687
is Beetroot.
Now, despite popular belief that Beetroot

361
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:13,392
stains your teeth, you should know that this
plant actually stops tooth decay, as recently

362
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:16,862
proven by the latest medical studies coming
from The Netherlands.

363
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:22,100
Your body converts beet root into nitric oxide,
which powers up your saliva’s healing properties,

364
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:26,138
and slows the growth of acid-producing bacteria
found in plaque.

365
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:30,375
The FOURTH STEP is to strengthen your teeth
crowns by filling them with minerals and vitamins.

366
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:33,612
This step is a lot like repairing cracked
walls.

367
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:38,784
The best ingredients to achieve this as fast
as possible are Dandelion, Alfalfa, Jujube

368
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,519
seeds and Zinc:

369
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,557
Dandelion greens provide a substantial amount
of several minerals, including iron, calcium,

370
00:23:45,557 --> 00:23:49,861
magnesium and potassium
Alfalfa reduces sensitivity and strengthens

371
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:53,932
the teeth
The Jujube seeds, native from Southern Asia,

372
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:58,670
are particularly rich in vitamin C, an important
vitamin with high antioxidant and immune-boosting

373
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,207
properties
While Zinc is a trace mineral, and can naturally

374
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:06,778
be found in saliva. It has been proven to
fight against the growth of bacteria and plaque

375
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:10,449
and - here comes the best part:
Zinc is also needed for your senses of taste

376
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:16,021
and smell. And a Zinc deficiency can highly
reduce your ability to taste or smell.

377
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:20,759
Not anymore - as now you will be able to taste
a sizzling steak or a delicious lava cake

378
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,329
as if it was your very first time eating these!

379
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:28,600
The FIFTH STEP is to purify and detoxify the
gut and balance the mouth bacteria, with a

380
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,271
powerful blend of Chicory Root, Celery Seed,
Burdock Root and Yellow Dock.

381
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:37,943
All these plants also play a huge role in
reducing inflammation, and improving mineral

382
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,079
absorption for steel-strong teeth.

383
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:45,450
The SIXTH AND FINAL STEP towards a complete
oral rejuvenation is to form an impenetrable

384
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,088
shield for your teeth and gums, making them
virtually indestructible against future bacteria

385
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:52,057
or food debris.

386
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:55,660
To achieve this, we’ve added Grape Seed
Extract - which prevents the growth of common

387
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,465
foodborne bacteria, Ginger - which contains
gingerol, which is excellent at fighting off

388
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:05,704
bacteria and preventing infection and Feverfew
- which acts like a natural pain relief, without

389
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:08,807
the harmful side effects of common drugs.

390
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:12,444
And in order to take advantage of all the
latest discoveries in the field of medicine,

391
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:18,383
to our formula we’ve added some powerful
amino acids – such as Methionine and L Cysteine,

392
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:22,454
which play an essential role in your body’s
detoxification process.

393
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:26,458
No toxic substances in the body, no more infections,
right?

394
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,528
Back to this day I don’t know why S.T. agreed
to share and help me gather all the powerful

395
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,565
ingredients...
Maybe it was because of my story…

396
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:38,803
Maybe because of his passion for natural remedies…
Or maybe because, working in the medical industry,

397
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:42,374
he had seen enough dentists stuffing their
pockets with money and leaving innocent people

398
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:48,613
to faith after risky and expensive surgeries…
But one thing’s for sure: we made an amazing

399
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:52,317
team.
Him, a walking “natural alternatives Encyclopedia”…

400
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:56,888
Me, with all my knowledge on chemistry, ready
to test every possible interaction between

401
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,592
the saliva and the various plants and herbs
he had discovered…

402
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:05,196
We worked night after night, testing until
dawn inside S.T.’s home laboratory…

403
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:09,701
Making sure that we got the right quantities
and the most effective combination of ingredients....

404
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:14,105
And there were times when I was so tired that
I could throw up but, in the end, there it

405
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:20,512
was: a solution that gathered all-powerful,
100% natural herbs, plants, minears and anti-bacterial

406
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,513
nutrients.

407
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,583
Of course, I was the very first one to try
it.

408
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:28,253
After the first day, I didn’t feel a thing.
Well, maybe hope, which was still something

409
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,457
I thought that I'd lost forever!
But when I woke up the second morning, something

410
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:36,361
had clearly changed.
There was no more blood after brushing. I

411
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,098
just couldn’t believe that- for the first
time in months- I wasn’t spitting blood

412
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,868
like in a horror villain.
The following days I just could believe my

413
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:49,107
eyes: more than half of the plaque had disappeared…
And soon after that, my heart stood still:

414
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:53,812
my front tooth wasn’t moving anymore.
Seeing my progress, I gathered a list of 20

415
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:57,582
people I knew who suffered from various forms
of gum disease and asked them to discreetly

416
00:26:57,582 --> 00:27:01,553
test out our formula.
Every single person accepted immediately,

417
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,923
especially because no one needed to leave
their house, as we personally delivered them

418
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:10,161
all the selected teeth-fortifying ingredients.
They each received a daily report form to

419
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:13,531
follow their progress.
I was prepared to wait at least a week for

420
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:18,003
the initial reports to come back.
But what happened next was amazing...

421
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,505
Even after 3 or 4 days, I was getting call
after call

422
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:24,242
from everyone in the study, claiming
their gums and teeth felt like new

423
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:28,013
They were stunned.
I was even more SHOCKED at how quickly my

424
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:32,050
gum swelling and tooth pain went away…
Honestly, when I woke up one morning and felt

425
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:37,689
no ache, and no metallic taste in my mouth…I
thought for a second that I was dead!

426
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:41,860
Faster than I thought, my gums had tightened
back up and completely re-attached to my teeth…

427
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,964
And soon, it was like my gum disease had never
happened. Plus, the shade of my teeth was

428
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:50,201
a lot lighter…
Not only that but, according to my wife, I

429
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:55,240
wasn’t grinding my teeth in my sleep anymore…
My life was completely normal again! I could

430
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,178
finally smile, eat whatever I pleased…and
nobody would ever judge me for how my teeth

431
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,013
looked!
And it wasn't just me...

432
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,617
When I went to collect the reports from the
other subjects in my initial study...

433
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:10,221
The results I saw were astounding!
Not a single person reported tooth pain, gum

434
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:15,693
inflammation, plaque or bad breath…
And most importantly: no loose teeth.

435
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:20,265
Even Dr. S.T. had seen nothing like it.
It was clear we couldn't keep this life-saving

436
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:24,569
protocol all to ourselves…
All the suffering had to end!

437
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:27,806
And we needed to make our discovery accessible
to as many people as possible.

438
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:32,677
So, we created a clinically proven and all-natural
supplement available for anyone who's tortured

439
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,345
by gum disease or tooth decay.

440
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:37,749
We’ve called it:
Steel Bite Pro

441
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:43,054
The 100% natural solution that you can use
to rebuild your gums and teeth starting today.

442
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,324
Once all the bacteria are destroyed, Seel
Bite Pro will help you to…

443
00:28:46,324 --> 00:28:51,096
· Stop bleeding and receding gums, while
you regain their healthy look and feel...

444
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:55,266
· Stop the pain and infections (this alone
will save your thousands in painful root canals

445
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,670
and other dental bills);
· Make the ugly plaque build-up literally

446
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:03,708
fall shed away your teeth;
· Escape gingivitis and periodontal diseases;

447
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,179
· Get rid of bad breath and all the embarrassing
moment caused by it;

448
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,783
· Enjoy the confidence of having whiter teeth,
without cavities;

449
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:16,087
· Never have to throw your savings on dental
implants and risk nerve damage or even facial

450
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:20,525
paralysis…
· And never, ever have to go to the dentist.

451
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:25,263
To create Steel Bite Pro, we’ve sourced
only the purest, highest quality 23 plants,

452
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:29,667
herbs, minerals and vitamins, measured the
exact quantities needed and put them into

453
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:33,138
an easy to swallow capsule to take once a
day.

454
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:38,777
Every capsule is manufactured in the USA,
in our FDA approved and GMP certified facility,

455
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:44,048
under sterile, strict and precise standards,
so you can be 100% sure it’s safe, clean

456
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:47,952
and of the highest quality.
Moreover, Steel Bite Pro capsules are non-GMO.

457
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:53,525
They do not contain any dangerous stimulants
or toxins, and they are not habit forming.

458
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:56,861
Not only is Steel Bite Pro revolutionary in
its approach…

459
00:29:56,861 --> 00:30:01,799
But it can be used by anyone, at any age,
regardless of their medical condition…

460
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,302
Even after years of neglect and decline.

461
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:09,841
To date, more than 57,000 Americans just like
you have already used the Steel Bite Pro personally,

462
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:14,279
or shared it with a loved one.
And across the board, the results are incredible:

463
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,016
Here’s what Gabriel Backer, 40 y. o., from
Baltimore, Maryland says:

464
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:22,453
“No more bleeding gums and I still can’t
believe I got rid of cavities! And to think

465
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:26,291
how easy it was. I’ve been using Steel Bite
Pro for three weeks now and I’ll share it

466
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:28,259
with everyone I know!”

467
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,362
Or Loretta Martin, 48, New Orleans, Louisiana,
who says:

468
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:36,501
“I was afraid to eat. Always cut everything
into tiny pieces and chewed them carefully.

469
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,805
After just one week of Steel Bite Pro, I finally
had the courage to eat my favourite food:

470
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,275
beef steak. It was a huge victory for me.”

471
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,711
And Dameon Sanders, 52, Flint, Michigan, who
says:

472
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:51,115
“I don’t think there’s a worse pain
than tooth pain. I couldn’t focus at work

473
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:55,019
or enjoy my free time and I was hooked on
painkillers. Now it’s like I’ve got my

474
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:59,390
life back. No more pain, it just feels so
good.”

475
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,261
All you have to do in order to achieve the
same life-changing results is to start using

476
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:06,998
it as soon as possible.
The solution is much simpler than you’d

477
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:07,999
think.

478
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,735
And you can get access to everything in the
next 90 seconds.

479
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:15,773
Now, knowing all of this, it's obvious why
Steel Bite Pro dominates any other option

480
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:16,774
to “fixing” gum disease…

481
00:31:16,774 --> 00:31:22,247
Nothing else out there proved to WORK...
Instead, Steel Bite Pro is a completely natural

482
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:27,652
and 100% effective way of destroying the dangerous
bacteria that are now lurking deep inside

483
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:32,290
your gums, sentencing you to tooth decay…
Of course, you could go to a dentist, who

484
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,127
will torture you with sick plaque cleaning
methods like dental scaling…… methods

485
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:40,565
that can’t reach the root cause of your
gum disease and eliminate the termite-bacteria…

486
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:45,103
Or maybe he'll talk you into expensive, lengthy
treatments like gum grafts or pocket elimination

487
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:50,808
surgery... treatments that no doctor can guarantee
they work - and good luck getting your insurance

488
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:55,480
to cover the costs of thousands of dollars!
Next, your doctor might suggest you to replace

489
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,618
your worst teeth with implants that cost $4,500
a pop, and have you wait one-and-a-half years

490
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:05,290
just to see if the operation was a success…not
to mention the termite-bacteria can still

491
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,727
cause an infection around the implant.
You could put your hopes inside special toothpastes

492
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:14,065
or fake “gum strengthening” creams- but
these will never be strong enough to be that

493
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:18,569
cure-all you're wishing for.
All are a waste of money, time, and energy

494
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:22,373
and you know it!
They won't get you well in a million years...

495
00:32:22,373 --> 00:32:26,411
Unlike Steel Bite Pro that can get the job
done in less than three weeks while keeping

496
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,814
your gums and teeth safe from future dental
disorders…

497
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:33,618
You can understand why Dr. S.T. and I initially
wanted to set the value for Steel Bite Pro

498
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,722
at $399.
That’s less than a gum graft surgery…

499
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,692
And certainly a lot less than the cost of
a dental implant…

500
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:44,562
Plus, with Steel Bite Pro you don’t run
the risk of infections or even face nerve

501
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:48,166
damage as it’s 100% natural and side-effect
free…

502
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:52,804
When you think about all of that, it should
be pretty clear why both I, and the more than

503
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:58,443
57,000 people who have already used Steel
Bite Pro personally… think that $399 is

504
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,677
a steal.

505
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,379
But This Is Not About Us Making A Profit

506
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:05,983
I’ve seen firsthand how using the Steel
Bite Pro gave me my life back, got me rid

507
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:10,855
of all the pain and humiliation….
And how I don’t have to lose sleep at night

508
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:14,192
worrying about whether one of my teeth will
fall or not, whether there’s an infection

509
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,028
that could spread to my brain and kill me
in a matter of hours…

510
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:21,366
Plus, I know the desperation of being sick
and broke…with no money to take care of

511
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,901
yourself…
Which is why I’m not going to ask you to

512
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:28,639
invest anywhere near the $399 I was initially
going to price this at…

513
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:36,447
Or even $299, or $199, or heck even $99.
Instead, and only while this website remains

514
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:40,651
online… which may not be that long given
the incredible threat it poses to big pharmaceutical

515
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:45,590
companies and dental conglomerates…
You can get your very own 30-day supply of

516
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,727
Steel Bite Pro
for a one-time 100% risk free investment of

517
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:53,998
$69.
That’s right. Just $69!

518
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:58,069
Before you order, one last thing: after thoroughly
researching all the ingredients of Steel Bite

519
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:03,374
Pro, and running dozens of tests - I recommend
you take this supplement for at least 90 days.

520
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:07,245
On one hand, it’s about giving your body
enough time to process and take full advantage

521
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:12,583
of all the plant extracts and steadily locate
and destroy every single colony bacteria.

522
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:16,421
This way, your teeth could absorb all the
minerals and nutrients, thus undoing years

523
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:19,924
and years of dental damage...
On the other hand, Steel Bite Pro is selling

524
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:24,228
incredibly fast and, once it will be sold
out, it will take us at least 6 to 9 months

525
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,932
to produce a new batch.
Not only because we’re accepting only the

526
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:32,270
purest ingredients but also because when an
ingredient is clinically proven to work so

527
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,741
well - like Berberine, Big Pharmaceutical
Companies buy up all the supplies of this

528
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,210
plant and pretend it’s for “research”
purposes.

529
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,947
They offer such a high price for it that it’s
creating an artificial shortage.

530
00:34:42,947 --> 00:34:48,085
Berberis, the shrubs from which Berberine
is extracted is incredibly hard to find in

531
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:50,455
the wild.
And even if there are a few Berberis farms

532
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:54,826
out there, even fewer of them grow it without
using chemicals, while most of them are filling

533
00:34:54,826 --> 00:35:00,331
their pockets right now thanks to pharma companies
buying up all their crops years in advance.

534
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:04,335
You might find it in bottles in a health food
store, but those supplies aren’t pure, or

535
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,972
they skimp on quality control to make up for
their lost profits from the high ingredient

536
00:35:07,972 --> 00:35:08,973
cost.

537
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,244
So yes, you can consider yourself lucky if
Steel Bite Pro is still in stock today.

538
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:16,614
But you know what?
I want you to take full advantage of how great

539
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:21,652
Steel Bite Pro is, and, at the same time,
save as much as you can on your health investment!

540
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:25,890
So I'm going to make the deal even sweeter:
Because I know how hard it is to live with

541
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,260
throbbing teeth pain, inflamed, bleeding gums
and bad breath…

542
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:34,232
I've set up a discounted package system of
6 bottles of Steel Bite Pro for you, for only

543
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:40,271
$49 dollars a bottle, for a total of $294
which is being offered TODAY ONLY... for as

544
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,141
long as supplies last. You also get free shipping
on us.

545
00:35:44,141 --> 00:35:47,578
Once we run out of bottles, the "BUY NOW"
buttons will not be active anymore until we

546
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:51,716
make another batch again (which takes around
2-3 months at least).

547
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:57,321
Click the 6-bottle package (or any other package
that you want) below to secure your order.

548
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:01,159
Consider this the smallest, but most powerful
investment that you have ever made for yourself!

549
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,596
Yes, 1 bottle of Steel Bite Pro might stop
bleeding and receding gums, while you regain

550
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:07,331
their healthy look and feel.…

551
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:11,936
3 bottles might be enough to rapidly stop
the pain and infections, saving you thousands

552
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:16,874
of dollars in painful root canals and other
dental bills AND remove all the ugly plaque

553
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,843
build-up from your teeth…

554
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:23,648
But 6 bottles of Steel Bite Pro will tighten
your loose gums and cement the teeth roots,

555
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:27,485
strengthen your teeth crowns and turn your
saliva into a super strong shield for your

556
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:33,791
teeth and gums, making them virtually indestructible
against future bacteria or food debris!

557
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,661
You may be saying,
“OK, this sounds amazing and I'm interested!

558
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:38,663
How do I get started?”

575
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:43,394
is for you or not. I’m taking all of the
risk here, and it doesn’t bother me one

576
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:46,464
bit.
I want to help as many Americans as I can,

577
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,467
which means making it as easy as possible
for you to try this today.

578
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:53,337
So, go ahead, choose your package and say
“maybe” by clicking the “Buy Now”

579
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:54,939
button below right now.

580
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,709
But please, know you really do have to act
now.

581
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,480
We are offering Steel Bite Pro for an amazing
price just to get this amazing solution into

582
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,850
more hands.
But we are planning on raising the price to

583
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:10,588
$99, or possibly much higher in the future.
Because here's the weird thing:

584
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:14,291
When I tell people that you can easily fight
gum disease and tooth decay… in practically

585
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:17,595
no time and for less than the price of an
electric toothbrush...

586
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:21,932
Well, most people think it's unbelievable,
as if there's something "fishy" going on.

587
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:26,504
But our mission is to spread Steel Bite Pro
to as many people as humanly possible, and

588
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:30,374
the big dream is for gum disease and dental
clinics to be a thing of the past!

589
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:35,012
But, if people find it hard to believe that
you can get such incredible results and destroy

590
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,716
life-threatening bacteria for less than a
meal with your family at a restaurant, then

591
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:42,053
we'll have to raise the price.
Not to mention we don't know how much longer

592
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,289
we'll be able to hide from Big Pharma's threats.

593
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,959
But if this website is still up, it means
you can still get the Steel Bite Pro if you

594
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,027
act now.

595
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,863
So, click the button below to place your order
now.

596
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:57,301
Listen, when you think about it, you really
have only two choices ahead of you right now:

597
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:01,772
Option one: Stop following this presentation
and leave this page. Do nothing. Keep going

598
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:06,043
the way you are now, with your gums always
sore and inflamed, risking life-threatening

599
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:10,014
infections and diseases.
Live in pain, fear and embarrassment... for

600
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:14,719
months, maybe even years, or decades. It's
not going to be pleasant.

00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:28,299
… Still here?
That's fine, this letter covered so much information

605
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,736
that it’s only natural you have some questions.
Let’s take a quick moment to answer some

606
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:35,940
typical questions asked by clients before
they choose the Steel Bite Pro…

607
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,810
1. How and why does Steel Bite Pro work?

608
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:44,949
Well the way this works is pretty simple actually…
Gum disease, tooth decay or bad breath have

609
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:49,453
nothing to do with how good your oral hygiene
is, but with a life-threatening bacteria buried

610
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:53,891
deep inside your gums, eating at your roots
and spreading like a plague to your throat,

611
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,428
nose and airways.
No teeth cleaning method can reach the places

612
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,398
where the dangerous bacteria hides, and the
only substance that can reach the bacteria

613
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:05,836
hiding place is your saliva.
The only solution is to turn your saliva into

614
00:40:05,836 --> 00:40:11,008
an incredibly powerful disinfectant & teeth
strengthener by using natural but extremely

615
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,145
potent ingredients.
This method is really inexpensive and has

616
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,747
no side-effects and works incredibly well!

617
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:22,653
2. Is this protocol for everyone?
Yes! Steel Bite Pro is non-invasive, risk-free

618
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:26,123
and was designed for people of all ages and
medical conditions.

619
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:31,562
3. When should I take Steel Bite Pro ?
We recommend you take 2 capsules each day,

620
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,499
with a big glass of water. You can take them
whenever you feel comfortable - either in

621
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:40,304
the morning, afternoon or even in the evening,
if you had a busy day and forgot about it.

622
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:44,942
4. What kind of results can I expect to see?
More than 57,000 people have now used the

623
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:49,346
Steel Bite Pro, and the results have been
remarkable. However, It depends on how quickly

624
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:54,318
your body responds to the ingredients used
in the protocol. Some people see changes faster,

625
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,588
while others may take longer.
So, please allow at least three weeks to see

626
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:59,490
a dramatic improvement.

627
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,993
5. How long will this program be available
for?

628
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:07,131
I can’t give you an exact answer here.
I want it to stay up forever, however the

629
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:12,436
pharmaceutical companies are becoming increasingly
hostile towards me, and starting to make threats.

630
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:16,440
As soon as my family is at risk – I’ll
have to take the site down. That means you

631
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,611
really should get this program right now,
especially since there is zero risk to you,

632
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:21,779
as I’ll explain in a second…

633
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:26,550
6. What’s with that guarantee again?
So, the reason there is no risk for you is

634
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,154
that you have a full 60 Days to try the Steel
Bite Pro for yourself.

635
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:34,692
If, for any reason over the next two months
you’re not satisfied, you simply send me

636
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:38,896
an email (I’ll provide my address inside)
and I’ll immediately refund your entire

637
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,600
investment with no questions asked. No dentist
will ever do that.

638
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:47,872
7. I'm ready to buy! What do I do now?
This one is easy: Simply choose your package

639
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:52,543
by clicking on one of the options below, and
try out the entire program for yourself, for

00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:57,281
60 days, with absolutely no risk. If you are
unhappy for any reason, you'll be given a

641
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,683
prompt refund, no questions asked...
